From the looks of things, the rap diva will be spending plenty of time outside, showing off her bodacious body. Her Twitter profile has already been lighting up with videos of her throwing it back in the club at 3 AM and salacious, <a href=# rel>flirtatious messages</a> to Moneybagg Yo's partner Ari Fletcher.

While Caresha's front is fully under wraps, nearly her entire backside is on display in the thong-cut garment. "God d*mn! Miami said, 'That's a motherf*cking thong, b*tch!'" a friend recording behind the camera yells out. The City Girl nonchalantly walks past two people while showing off her goods, both of whom awkwardly stroll away as she proudly lets her star power shine.</p><p>It remains unclear what else Caresha, Diddy, and their other collaborators have in store to promote their new single, but knowing them, it definitely won't be lowkey.

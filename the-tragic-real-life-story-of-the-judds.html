In 1996, Judd and her partner, Arch Kelley, had a baby together that they named Grace. Several years later, they welcomed their son, Elijah. The couple married in January 1996, but within two years, they separated, as reported by <a href=#>US Magazine</a>.</p><p>But her lowest point came after she decided to give marriage another shot, pairing up with her former bodyguard D.R. Roach. The marriage seemed happy until the unthinkable happened. Roach was arrested on charges of attempted aggravated sexual battery against a minor. As <a href=#>CNN</a> reports, this development threw Judd into what she calls "mama bear mode," which meant getting him out of her house within an hour and protecting her children.</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Boot</a>, Judd and Moser started dating in 2009 after years of knowing each other. Many years prior, they had even toured together, and Moser remembers feeling an attraction. But Judd wasn't having any part of it because of his mullet. Hairdos aside, the couple married in the summer of 2012. But horror struck when Moser suffered a terrible motorcycle crash in August 2012 requiring the amputation of his leg. Judd nursed him back to health. Today, they're still flourishing as a couple and perform together, too.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.

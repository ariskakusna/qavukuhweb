The star took to Instagram this week to share photos focusing on the architectural design, posting alongside the snapshots: "A little architectural love." While the majority of Kourtney's followers had positive things to say about the photos, one naysayer wrote: "The one thing she posts architectural love is a basic box." The mother-of-three responded to the comment, writing: "If that's a basic box you see, you can't see what I see."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c2c0d76d7789-kourtney-kardashian-travel-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e9nIIwCx6iM data-wc=8><strong>Kourtney Kardashian defended her travel photo from&nbsp;Utah</strong></p><p id=eL0mZp1soHr data-wc=86>The reality star recently opened up about how she responds to negativity online during an interview on her lifestyle website, Poosh. Kourtney admitted that she often finds herself responding to negative comments, even though she knows she shouldn't. She said: "There's so much positivy but I think we tend to focus on the negative. I notice myself that the negative questions stand out to me and I just want to respond to those people sometimes, even more so than the positive ones, which isn't always fair."</p><p id=eJftLvdOBeF data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Lopez reveals heartbreak after cancelling wedding to A-Rod</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10abdbb3dfe9-kourtney-kardashian-kids-holiday-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eaGnazuRvYV1 data-wc=12><strong>The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star with children Penelope and Reign</strong></p><p id=enb6SiXcXIay data-wc=117>Kourtney continued: "I noticed the other day that someone had left a comment on a photo I had posted, saying 'pregnant, pregnant, pregnant' and I commented back saying this is the shape of my body. I have definitely gained a few pounds during this quarantine time and I love my body and I am proud of my shape, and I am obviously posting it. I don't think I look pregnant at all, we are all shaped differently and that's my body and I am proud of it. That's how I respond to the negative comments, although it isn't always easy. Sometimes I can be more sarcastic, but I think kill them with kindness is always my motto."</p><p id=ebU7Y9DrpA46 data-wc=1><strong>READ:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Reese Witherspoon shares recipe for green juice that will make your skin glow</a></p><p id=e4U4fOFgVqBP data-wc=50>While Kourtney has been unable to travel abroad during the lockdown, the doting mum enjoyed&nbsp;spending quality time with her children on the trip.&nbsp;The star shares Mason, ten, Penelope, seven, and five-year-old Reign with ex Scott Disick, and the kids split their time between their mum and dad's houses.</p><p id=eC1StXlBRUKJ data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

"I got chills all over my body and ran right straight back to my laptop, got my GoPro footage, and lo and behold, Gabby's van was on there," Bethune said (she's since <a href=#>uploaded the footage</a> of the discovery).</p><p dir=ltr>Bethune recalled that she and her husband noticed the van, but "didn't think anything of it." She continued, "... the van had Florida plates, and we wanted to stop and say hi. But the van was very dark, closed up, looked like no activity, so we ended up just keeping driving." Bethune revealed that she got to call Petito's mother after realizing she had seen the van. "It was beautiful, we got to share some moments together on FaceTime," she said. "Just two moms, really just have a great cry." She added, "I am so sad that we couldn't bring her back alive. To be able to bring her home to her family, or help with that, is everything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2liZYF2e8isZK2gmah6tbTEZquiqF2ptaLAjJupqKOVYsGpsYygmJuaqWK9psDIraZmm5Gosm7DyJ2cZqegmrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

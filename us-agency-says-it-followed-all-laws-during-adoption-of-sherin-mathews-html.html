However, after India's recent decision, the organization's website says applications for adoptions from India are no longer being accepted.</p><p>As several adoptions will be impacted by the decision, the agency said that for the adoptions from India in process, "We've contacted our families in the adoption process from India, and we are working to smoothly transfer each family to another reputable agency."</p><p>Following the incident, India's nodal body for adoption Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), has made mental well-being of overseas applicants seeking to adopt a child an important criterion for determining their eligibility.</p><p>"We are not accepting new applications to adopt from India until the temporary suspension is lifted following CARA's investigation," it said.</p><p>Sherin's adoptive parents are in jail.</p><p>Sherin's adoptive father, 37-year-old Wesley Mathews was on Friday indicted on a capital murder charge by a grand jury and faces life in prison or the death penalty. He also faces charges of abandoning a child and tampering with evidence.</p><p>Sherin's foster mother, Sini Mathews was indicted on a charge of abandoning a child. The punishment for that ranges from two to 20 years in prison with a fine up to $10,000.</p><p>Wesley originally told police that Sherin had disappeared after he put her outside as a punishment for not drinking her milk. Police said he changed his story after her body was found on October 24, saying he removed her body from their home after she choked on her milk.</p><p>He told authorities that he had put Sherin's body in his car with a bag of trash. Her body was later found in a culvert just miles from her home.</p><p>Sini was arrested on a charge of child abandonment or endangerment based on her husband's admission to police that they both took Sherin's sister out to dinner and left the toddler home alone the night before she died.</p><p>The couple's biological daughter remains in CPS custody. Their parental rights will be determined in a civil trial scheduled for the end of this month. They can either forfeit their parental rights, or the court will decide to schedule a civil trial to possibly terminate their rights.</p><p><b>Read more: <a href=#>Latest world news</a> | <a href=#>In a first, Saudi women watch men's football in stadium</a></b><br></p><ul class=tipPop><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.onmanorama.com/etc/designs/malayalam/clientlibs/img/tweetshare.png id=shareTW width=20 height=16 alt="alt text" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></li></ul>×<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmp52nqHy4u9Glm2hqYGaFcHyQaGhsZ6WoeqKzxKeasmWjlsa0ecitZJ%2BnnKG8uLHDZpilpF2hrri%2FjJ2sq6GenHqisM6pq6KnnmK8p3nSoZyroZ5iuqLAx56urGaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

He was 55.</p><p>Just three hours prior to his Nov. 19 accident, Pastore spoke of the dangers associated with his penchant for motorcycles. Radio station KKLA-FM Los Angeles on Monday posted a short announcement of its host’s death as well as audio of what it was calling&nbsp;Pastore’s “prophetic sound bite” from the day of the accident.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2012</a></strong></p><p>On that day, Pastore was discussing an episode of Through the Wormhole, a TV show on the Science Channel hosted by <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_morgan-freeman data-tag=morgan-freeman>Morgan Freeman</a></strong>. The episode explored the possibility of life after death.</p><p>“Look, you guys know I ride a motorcycle, right?” Pastore asked his audience three hours before he collided with a car as he rode down the 210 Freeway near Los Angeles.</p><p>“So, at any moment, especially with the idiot people who cross the diamond lane into my lane, all right, without any blinkers – not that I’m angry about it – at any minute I could be spread all over the 210. But that’s [just] my body part, and that key distinction undergirds the entire Christian worldview.”</p><p>Hear his remarks <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY</strong>: <strong>Australian DJs Suspended, Radio Station Pulls Ads After Prank Leads to Suicide</strong></a></p><p>Pastore was born in Aug. 21, 1957, in Alhambra, Calif., made his major league debut as a pitcher with the Cincinnati Reds on April 4, 1979. In a losing effort against the San Francisco Giants, Pastore pitched three scoreless innings that day. He stayed with the Reds until 1985 then played one season for the Minnesota Twins.</p><p>After baseball, Pastore studied business, philosophy, religion and <a href=# id=auto-tag_politics data-tag=politics>politics</a> at various universities and became a born-again Christian. He became host of The Frank Pastore Show on KKLA nine years ago and turned it into one of the largest Christian talk shows in the country.</p><p>On Nov. 19, Pastore was riding his Honda VTX 1800 in the carpool lane of the 210 freeway when he was struck by a Hyundai Sonata in the lane next to him. He was hospitalized with serious head injuries.</p><p><strong><a href=#>STORY: Kate Middleton Radio Prank DJs ‘Heartbroken’ Over Suicide</a></strong></p><p>At KKLA’s website Monday, a message read: “As many of you are aware, Frank Pastore was in a motorcycle accident Monday night, 11/19. [Wife] <strong>Gina Pastore</strong> informed us that in the early afternoon of Monday, December 17, Frank passed away.

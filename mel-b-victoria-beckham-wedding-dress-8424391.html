In fact, she plans on going big (and not going home) with a minimum of three different dresses. "I don't think it would be fair to just have one," she told hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager (spoken like a true pop star). "Just have as many as you want — at least three, right?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm going to really go for it,"&nbsp;she continued. "One to actually get married in, which is the proper ceremony — very proper at this church, St. Paul’s [Cathedral]. And then maybe I want to change out of that and be a bit more less… You know, I actually don't know!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It makes perfect sense that Brown will need several dresses fit for a princess: she and McPhee are tying the knot at St. Paul’s, the same church where Princess Diana and Prince Charles had their 1981 wedding. She scored the venue thanks to her status as an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire), which she received in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So I got an MBE for all my charity work that I’ve been doing and creating awareness for all that kind of stuff," she explained.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6jZppdq7akwM6roJplkpqwrLTApmSwnZSZtq%2BzjJ2pnqujYoV1fpNscGo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

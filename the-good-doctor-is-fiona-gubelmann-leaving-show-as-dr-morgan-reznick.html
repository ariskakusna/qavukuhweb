Back in April, the 43-year-old celebrated the show's renewal for a seventh season, and her Instagram post suggests that she will be returning for the next instalment. The caption read: "Congratulations to everyone!!

"I don't think you should resign, because you don't have to do it all alone," he told her. "You're the reason I wake up in the morning, so whatever there is to figure out, all I want in the world is for us to do it as a family."&nbsp;</p><p id=eGolwwjxTiI data-wc=73>In one of the sweetest moments in the episode, Morgan and Alex then shared a passionate kiss before she hilariously handed Eden over to him. "She has a dirty diaper and I have 30 lab reports to review," Morgan said, before heading back to work. After the will-they-won't-they storyline between these two characters this season, it seems unlikely that Fiona would suddenly leave the show when their romance is finally back on track.&nbsp;</p><p id=ek5N_zM-lJ data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGpuY2p8tbTEZp6op5RisbCv06ipZqGjYrOqu82aZKCtkpq5rq3Np2SlnZGrtq%2BzjKyfqK9dlsBusNFmpKiql5a7br7Es6Wim5tk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The government needs to step in a regulate the spirits business.

He's working with renowned civil rights attorney Ben Crump on the case and recently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the situation with congressional leaders. “Suntory Global Spirits is a $20 billion a year company, when they don’t follow compliance they just pay a fine. Would you mind paying a fine, when you make $20 billion a year. I gotta fight them can’t just let them beat me out of my money,” 50 Cent said at the time.

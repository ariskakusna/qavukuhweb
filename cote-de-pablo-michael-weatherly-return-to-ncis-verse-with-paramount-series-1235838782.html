Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly are set to star in an untitled, Paris-set spinoff of the series, reprising their roles as, respectively, Ziva David and Tony DiNozzo. The series order comes on the heels of Weatherly returning to the flagship CBS series last week as NCIS paid tribute to the late David McCallum."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The series order comes on the heels of Weatherly returning to the flagship CBS series last week as NCIS paid tribute to the late David McCallum.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">De Pablo left NCIS in 2013, and Weatherly departed two years later. In the show’s story, Tony left the service to raise his and Ziva’s daughter after her supposed death. When she was discovered to be still alive years later (de Pablo made several guest appearances in season 17), she completed a final mission and was reunited with Tony and their daughter in Paris.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The new series will pick up from there. Per the show’s logline, “When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, try to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so that they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We’ve been talking about this story for many years, and now with John McNamara at the helm, we are ready,” Weatherly and de Pablo said in a statement. “The world of Tony and Ziva (and daughter Tali) promises to be an action-packed roller coaster fueled by love, danger, tears and laughter. We also want to acknowledge and thank the fans from around the world who supported the ‘TIVA’ movement for years. To this day, they say hello in grocery stores and on the street to tell us how much these characters mean to them and ask what Tony and Ziva are up to now. This is for you.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As with all shows in the NCIS franchise, the spinoff will be produced by CBS Studios. John McNamara wrote the premiere episode and will serve as showrunner, executive producing with the two stars, Laurie Lieser, Christina Strain and Shelley Meals.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m incredibly excited to step into the&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;universe with Cote and Michael and thrilled to explore it from a few new angles,” said McNamara. “Given that the franchise is such a global sensation, I think it’s phenomenal that CBS Studios and Paramount+ have given us the green light to shoot in Europe. As to the title of this series, if I told you what it is, I’d be violating the Espionage Act.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The untitled Paramount+ series will be the first NCIS show to originate on streaming. The original series is in its 21st season on CBS, where it leads into NCIS: Hawai’i on Monday nights. NCIS: Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans both had long lives on CBS, and the franchise’s first international edition, NCIS: Sydney, premiered in Australia and the U.S. last fall. The five shows to date have aired a combined 993 episodes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">De Pablo is repped by UTA and Entertainment 360. Weatherly is repped by Anonymous Content, Verve and McKuin Frankel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnKatnV2Zsm68wJujqGWdnrCprcSlZLCdkam1pr7LsmSrnaSqv69506hkp5uZqHq3sdGsnGavmam1brzAq5imp6WjwW6%2FxKugnqtdZn90gZdsb3BwYmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

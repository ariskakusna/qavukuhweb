The father of one has amassed some serious stacks after spending many years pouring into his career as a rapper, actor, and producer, among other things. As he's brought in more financial abundance, Champagne Papi has been increasingly generous in giving back to fans and people in need. Most recently, he teamed up with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">online betting company Stake</a> to hand out $1 million this weekend. According to the rapper's latest Instagram post, those tuning in to Saturday's (June 3) live stream might see him getting handsy with the feet of a famous Instagram model.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"THE BOY IS BACK TO CRACK A <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>SAFE</a> @stake," Drake wrote in the caption of his promotional upload on Monday. "SATURDAY THE RETURN OF THE BTC BANDIT AKA ROULETTE RANSACKER AKA PRAGMATIC POACHER AKA HACKSAW HIJACKER ðŸ˜ˆ. I might massage @corinnakopf feet live on air, you just never know," he further teased before urging his followers to tune in.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-is-feeling-flirtatious-ahead-of-saturday-s-stream>Drake is Feeling Flirtatious Ahead of Saturday's Stream</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Down in the comments, Kopf left an "I'm waiting ðŸ¦¶ðŸ¦¶" reply, letting her fellow Stake ambassador know that her feet are ready for his incredibly wealthy hands. As HipHopDX reports, interested users can participate in the giveaway by creating an account, being at least 18 years old, and having a verifiable phone number. Things will kick off this Saturday at 8 PM ET on Drake's Kick live stream â€“ a platform that his blonde bombshell friend also has a partnership with. Knowing this, it's entirely possible we'll see her entertaining viewers alongside the Certified Lover Boy.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the news, the Canadian has been busy preparing for his It's All A Blur tour with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> later this month, though he didn't miss an opportunity to shout out a fan going viral on TikTok for killing one of his old verses.

So, what I offered him was an opportunity for us to take a break for a year or two and let him go find someone to have a child with. And then when he has his baby, we could get back together.”</p><p>Roman added that she would not have any issues with<a href=# rel> helping to raise the child</a>, but she does not want to endure the physical and mental hardships that come with in vitro fertilization. She already has two adult daughters that she shared with her former NBA star ex-husband Kenny Anderson.</p><p>“It’s just...I don’t want to have it, I don’t want to get my eggs," said Roman. "It’s really about him being able to have his legacy here because he’s an only child. And he does not have any children, so it’s really more for him than it is for me.” Watch below.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjboN2gJFmq5qlmWK%2FsLnAp2SgoaaawG601KyZmqaUYsGpsYygqZ6dnmK5qrPHrWStp12drrexjJuYm7FdrLa1tIyapaismJq%2FbsPOppinZZ6axLQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

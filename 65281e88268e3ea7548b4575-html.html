However, these types of conflicts that involve religion have never been so black and white. Everybody but extremeists agrees that any type of violence is unacceptable, especially against civilians. <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner </a></strong>decided to voice her support for the people of Israel with that sentiment but those who support Palestine attacked her and pushed her to delete her Instagram post. Jenner was echoing sister Kim Kardashian's sentiments towards those who were killed in Israel but the online hate was harsh against her.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Iron Dome intercepting Hamas rockets over Israel sky - Video</span></p></figure><p>After deleting her post, Jenner decided to make another one where she felt the need to express she wasn't necessarily taking any sides. This is what she wrote on her Instagram stories: "My call to action today, something we can all do, is simply to reach out to your friends, colleagues, and those in your community who are hurting. No matter what side they are on, check in on them and tell them you love them. I also ask that, during difficult times like these, not to judge who is or isn't speaking out, because everyone should be allowed to deal with times of crisis in the way that they feel most comfortable, whether it be privately or publicly."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Celebrities like Kylie Jenner often get criticized for this</h2><p>There are plenty of examples of other celebrities like Kylie Jenner who are getting this type of backlash for posting support for one side or the other. In such a nuanced issue that is almost impossible to resolve. Famous people who express their opinion will always get criticized for taking sides. This doesn't mean they have to stay quiet and not say what they feel. It only means they need to understand that expressing anything about this conflict will always get them chastized by the side that opposes their view. There is a funny clip from Jon stewart's 'The Daily Show' from nine years ago that perfectly describes this sentiment. Elon Musk reposted it on his X account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHJ8jmppaG5lZ4VysZdxaW9wlWiyooOUbW%2BbbGVsgm%2B006aj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

The news anchor shared an adorable picture with her father, Jim and fans were quick to comment on the joyful snap, with one writing: "He looks full of life just like his daughter."&nbsp;</p><p id=edBVYPB3qR data-wc=18>But others were left divided as they couldn't decide which of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Dylan's&nbsp;</a>sons looked more like their grandfather.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1go_uTBHz data-wc=18>"I see Rusty in your Dad!" wrote one fan as another commented: "I think Ollie looks like him."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-pOTuLlXK data-wc=13>"Y'all share the same smile... and gosh Rusty favors him!!" added a third.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew9EcRj2Ha data-wc=56>For the special day, Dylan, 41, posted the snap that saw her and her father cheesing at the camera with big smiles. A second post honored her husband Brian Fichera, as she shared a screengrab of a text he had sent that quipped: "I am prepared to be honored on this last day of Father's Week."&nbsp;</p><p id=e-jjn25eVd data-wc=45>"We joke and tease about the all important Father’s Day and how much we should pamper the dads, but honestly, @fishlense brings nothing but happiness, laughter, and love into all our lives. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there!" Dylan captioned the post.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20efe95b2741-dylan-dreyer-on-vacation-with-husband-brian-fichera.jpg><p id=eqapnRyIcH data-wc=68><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>The happy parents are mom and dad to their three children</a>, Calvin, six, Oliver, three and one-year-old, Rusty. &nbsp;Dylan somehow manages to juggle motherhood and her career and regularly shares a relatable look at her family life such as when she<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;posted a snap of her balancing a buggy in one hand</a> and a metal basket in the other, while attempting to pack the trunk of the car.&nbsp;</p><p id=erHPhqeozv data-wc=79>While it may be hectic, Dylan and Brian wouldn't change a thing about their happy life together. She opened up about her children and her husband in 2022 and told <strong>HELLO!:&nbsp;</strong>"I wish I had started having kids sooner. "Because I really love everything about kids. I never thought I would love it as much as I do. Being a mom is the best. I love fostering their ideas, I also somehow found more patience after becoming a mom."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fce51862cbd0-screen-shot-2023-05-14-at-104324-am.png><p id=eVUboFyZx5Q data-wc=21>A recent<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;TiKTok video of Dylan's went viral, however,</a> after revealing her unique way of ignoring her rowdy and loud children.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRngzLhqVM data-wc=40>"Dyls masterclass in how to silence your rowdy children has reached 1 million views. Your support has been overwhelming," Brian quipped in his caption of the video, which showed her shaking a cocktail shaker and singing: "I can't hear you."&nbsp;</p><p id=eteKpJu2ib data-wc=20>Dylan herself reacted incredulously to the news, telling Today.com: "He just told me it hit a million views. That's crazy!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eXCsQXCLwo data-wc=52>She continued: "Here's the thing: Some people might not love the idea of drinking around your kids and to those people I say 'don't judge!' I've got three boys who love being loud and love loud noises, so what better way to get the noise party started than with a cocktail shaker!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx1hZRxbWpnpKSxosXSZpuypJGjeqW%2BxLKcq2Wjmr%2Bqu9Sso7JllJ7DqrDErGSfmZ6oeri106FkpZmkmsC1ecWapKKkqWK9qbvTqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

data-sourcepos=7:1-7:94><span>Before Jacksonville was Jacksonville,</span><span> it was a simpler time.</span><span> Native Americans of the Timucua tribe knew the area as "Wacca Pilatka,</span><span>" which translates roughly to "cow crossing.</span><span>" Now,</span><span> that's a name that paints a real picture,</span><span> doesn't it?</span><span> We're talking cattle hoofing it across the shallow waters of the St.</span><span> Johns River.</span><span> Not exactly the image of swaying palm trees most folks associate with Florida.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:311><span>Then came the Brits.</span><span> Being Brits,</span><span> they weren't too keen on such a fancy,</span><span> foreign name.</span><span> So,</span><span> with that pragmatic spirit they're known for,</span><span> they dubbed it "Cowford.</span><span>" Because,</span><span> well,</span><span> it was a ford (a shallow place in a river where you could cross on foot or by animal) used by cows.</span><span> You gotta respect the efficiency.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:139><strong>Enter Andrew Jackson: The Man, the Myth, the Town Namensake</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:332><span>Fast forward to 1821,</span><span> when Florida became part of the United States.</span><span> The new territory needed a leader,</span><span> and who better than the war hero himself,</span><span> Andrew Jackson?</span><span> Old Hickory,</span><span> as he was nicknamed (because apparently,</span><span> he was as tough as hickory wood),</span><span> became the first military governor.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:329><span>Now,</span><span> this is where things get interesting.</span><span> To honor this powerful figure,</span><span> the newly established town on the St.</span><span> Johns River (which was still very much cow-centric) was bestowed with a grand new name:</span><span> Jacksonville!</span><span> It was a bold choice,</span><span> a name that evoked leadership,</span><span> strength,</span><span> and...</span><span> well,</span><span> maybe a vague association with cattle.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:391><strong>A Name Fit for a City, Not a Farmyard</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:396><span>Jacksonville stuck,</span><span> even though Andrew Jackson,</span><span> as far as anyone knows,</span><span> never actually set foot in the town that bears his name.</span><span> Maybe he was too busy battling the British or chasing Native Americans (a not-so-great part of his legacy,</span><span> to be honest).</span><span> But hey,</span><span> a city needs a name,</span><span> right?</span><span> And Jacksonville,</span><span> though a little on the nose (or should we say,</span><span> hoof?</span><span>),</span><span> certainly has a certain ring to it.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:102><strong>How To:</strong><span> Jacksonville Name Edition (Quick

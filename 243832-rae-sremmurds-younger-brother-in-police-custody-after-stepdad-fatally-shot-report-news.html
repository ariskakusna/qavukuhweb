He's currently being held for a psychiatric evaluation and is currently the only person being investigated in connection to the murder. At this point, there isn't much information regarding the actual shooting itself as police are currently investigating the situation. However,&nbsp;Lee County Medical Examiner confirmed that the victim of the shooting is Floyd Sullivan.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sullivan has been in Swae and Slim Jxmmi's lives since they were in middle school in Texas. From there, they moved to Tupelo along with Sullivan and their mom who had supported them in Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At this point, it's unclear how much knowledge of the incident Swae Lee or Slim Jxmmi have of the situation. However, Swae Lee did post a selfie with a broken heart emoji on Monday evening. It's unclear whether that was in response to the news. We're keeping the family of Rae Sremmurd and their associates in our thoughts during this time.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.

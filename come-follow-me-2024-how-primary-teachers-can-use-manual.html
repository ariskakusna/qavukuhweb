Wright</a>, first counselor in the Primary general presidency, a young girl named Abby goes over these resources and gives suggestions.</p><p>“First, when you prepare to teach Primary, start by reading the scriptures on your own and with your family. As you do, the Spirit can give you ideas about how to help your Primary class learn about Jesus Christ,” she said.</p><p>When teachers get to Primary, maybe they will find that some of the children in their class have already done some of the activities at home with their families.</p><p>“That’s OK. We don’t mind doing them again. That’s how we learn,” Abby said. “Ask us to share what we learned at home. Every time we teach each other, the Holy Ghost helps our testimony of Jesus Christ grow.”</p><p>Abby also reminded teachers to help every child be a part of the lesson whether or not they have been studying the scriptures at home with their families.</p><p>And out of everything that Primary teachers teach, showing love to their classes will help the children feel Heavenly Father’s love, the video concluded.</p><p>In a <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Church News article on Jan. 1</a>, the Sunday School general presidency said although church classes matter, home is the best place to study the gospel. Rather than simply showing up for church lessons, members should learn at home and then share what they’re learning at church.</p><p>“Our children can do this at home because the manual is exactly the same. Parents will have access to everything,” said <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Brother Milton Camargo</a>, first counselor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/deseret.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3a88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/789x1024+0+0/resize/730x947!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F2MtpV3b0PBfa82kaCSird71aqO8%3D%2F0x0%3A789x1024%2F789x1024%2Ffilters%3Afocal%28395x512%3A396x513%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F25205823%2FBook_of_Mormon_keystone.jpg"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfoba3tc2gZJ%2BZmam1cH6Pa2toaV9qfHOAj2tsb25kZLCwucRmnaiknKTEbrnEZmlpamRitbDDjKmpoqWRp8ZuwMSamqGdoqh6pK3NZqysnV2irq%2FBwKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

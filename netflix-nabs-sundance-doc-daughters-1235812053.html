Patton is the CEO of Girls for a Change, a nonprofit that launched the Date With Dad Program, which holds a dance for the daughters of men incarcerated in a D.C. prison. The documentary details a ten-week program the men enter upon in preparation for the dance, as well as the anticipation the girls feel for the big day.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Daughters peaks an hour in with the father-daughter dance, which is astonishing and as potent as you could hope for.

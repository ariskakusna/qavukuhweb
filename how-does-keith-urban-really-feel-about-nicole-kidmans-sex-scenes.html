The Oscar winner, promoting her new Hulu series "Nine Perfect Strangers" on August 9 with E! News' "<a href=#>Daily Pop</a>," shared, "My husband is an artist, so he understands all of it, and he also does not get involved."&nbsp;</p><p>Kidman added that Urban, whose country music career is still very much thriving itself, keeps to his side of the street when it comes to Kidman's acting roles. "He sees the show at the very end when it's a show, all edited together, and he's fresh eyes," she told "Daily Pop. "He doesn't read any script, he really doesn't know what's going on on the set, he's got his own career that he's completely absorbed in." Kidman also laughed, "He doesn't know much about what I'm really doing."</p><p>Urban staying hands-free in his wife's career has worked out for the couple thus far, as he told Dax Shepard's "<a href=#>Armchair Expert</a>" podcast in September 2020 the two never feel an urge to be competitive even with their respective successes. "There's so many other things that I can bring that help and blossom the family, and protect it, and take care of it and grow it, not just fiscally," Urban told Shepard. "I bring everything I can most of the time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbXBjaoV5e8eormacn5rAbrfEoquhZaWnr6K6jKucmqScrnqnscSlZJqan6rBbrrInKalnV2gtqW5wKeqZquVrXq0r8SnnKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

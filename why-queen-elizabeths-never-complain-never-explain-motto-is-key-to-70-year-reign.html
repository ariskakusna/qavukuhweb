But her spoken words are almost entirely the work of others."</p><p>Borman who is the author of Crown & Sceptre: A New History of the British Monarchy, claimed the matriarch's tight-lipped approach to public life is due to the motto, "never complain, never explain".</p><p>The motto was used by the Queen Mother and is thought to come from the 19th-century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

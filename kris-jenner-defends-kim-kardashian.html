Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing or where Kanye West was going on vacation and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success. "Kris was quick to jump to her daughter's defence, and spoke of the power couple's work ethic. "Kanye, first of all, doesn't go on vacation, ever," said Kris, speaking on her new talk show. "And Kim is the hardest-working young lady in the world. She never sleeps, she never stops, she never slows down and works so hard for what she's got.""I was thinking about her 10,000-square-foot house, and I thought, 'Wow, her job affords her to live in a 10,000-square-foot house'. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, Mr President's job affords him to live in a 55,000-square-foot house," added Kris.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0153172eb4ca-kris-z.jpg><p id=eh9jViDQFkn7 data-wc=88>The self-proclaimed momager then pointed out that the family's TV shows, notably , had a wider impact on the country's economy as it employed "hundreds and hundreds of people".Kim and Kanye are getting ready to move into their <a class=hm-link href=#>£7million Bel Air mansion</a> and their latest purchase was reportedly six of the limited-edition Savoir Royal State Beds, which totalled £750,000.The couple bought the sumptuous mansion together at the start of this year and have meanwhile been living with Kris in her Calabasas mansion while their house is being refurbished.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

She told me he mostly wanted oral sex and she gave in to Bob to protect her job</strong>." She added.</p><p></p><p>The informant said "She told me, 'Bob Barker made my life a nightmare, <strong>Dian said Barker always called himself 'Daddy' and called his dressing room 'Daddy's Room</strong>.' She told me that for more than three years, he forced her to have sex against her will."</p><p>"After he had his way with her, he'd dismiss her and take a nap. Dian once told me: <strong>'I feel like a sex toy, something for him to play with and throw away when he's finished</strong>.'"</p><p>Diane quit The Price Is Right in 1993 after his sexual abuse caused her a bleeding ulcer, "I told everyone I left to pursue other avenues of my career," she told the tipster. "<strong>But my doctors told me it was the show and possible death - or quit ... The only answer was to get away from that monster Bob Barker</strong>."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Meanwhile, Bob Barker denied the whole thing back in 1994</h2><p>Barker also spoke with the National Enquirer claiming that <strong>"I didn't force Dian Parkinson to have sex. She aggressively pursued ME - and told other people on the set she was going to be the next Mrs. Bob Barker!</strong>"</p><p>Back then, Barker also mentioned that Parkinson demanded<strong> $8 million in payoff </strong>and that she was willing to take the case to court if needed.</p><p>Although Barker admitted he had a complicated relationship with Parkinson after the death of his wife, he also mentioned that <strong>"Dian is a user out for financial reward, she flirted with me for years. A long list of people will testify that she was very affectionate with me on the set</strong>,".</p><p>Barker also mentioned that "<strong>She's come into my dressing room wearing only a robe, and she'd be all over me - sitting on my lap and running her fingers through my hair. My make-up artist and hairdresser would have to ask her to stop so they could do their jobs!</strong>"</p><p>At the time that Parkinson left the show, she filed an <strong>$8 million sexual harassment lawsuit </strong>but dropped it a year later due to legal costs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6trWarmKTEtHuRaWlsZ2BufHGAjm9rn21il655gJVqbWyeY5qudoTBbWxxm16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

Shiny Pokemon have a certain novelty to them simply due to the fact that they are very rare Pokemon to catch and players want to show off their achievements. That is why during events, shiny Pokemon more than often have a higher rate to find shiny Pokemon.</p><p>Now that it is February, Pokemon GO fans are preparing for the <a href=#>last events</a> of the Mythical Wishes season. With the Valentine's Day event coming to Pokemon GO, players are looking ahead to see what is coming during that time period. Frillish will be one of the featured Pokemon during that event and so players are asking can you get a <strong>shiny Frillish</strong> in Pokemon GO? We will answer that question here.</p><h2><strong>Is Shiny Frillish Coming To Pokemon GO?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/wXXWu96s7o986q0q3Q03-0oCaoLo1jTlr4-F2eTYWGk/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9wb2tlbW9uX2dvX2ZyaWxsaXNoX3NoaW55L3Bva2Vtb25fZ29fc2hpbnlfZnJpbGxpc2hfMi5qcGc><p>To answer the question very quickly, <strong>shiny Frillish is indeed coming to Pokemon GO</strong>. Pokemon GO is entering the final stages of the current season that is in, but that does not mean that there cannot be more events. The Valentine's Day event will feature a lot of different Pokemon in the game, which includes Frilish.</p><p>Players will be able to encounter shiny Frillish during the <strong>Valentine's Day event</strong> in Pokemon GO. The event starts from February 8th until February 14th. Once it hits the 15th, your opportunity to catch shiny Frillish will end and you will have missed your chance to do so.</p><h2><strong>How Do I Get Shiny Frillish In Pokemon GO?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/RCsFXggdHao-HPmLRsZkHN5z6htEstriOC0DnkM0sII/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9wb2tlbW9uX2dvX2ZyaWxsaXNoX3NoaW55L3Bva2Vtb25fZ29fc2hpbnlfZnJpbGxpc2hfM19zaXplLnBuZw><p>Because this is the first time shiny Frillish will be available in Pokemon GO, there are a couple of different ways to encounter this Pokemon. The first is to <strong>simply encounter one in the wild</strong>. Players can also participate in both <strong>Timed Research and Field Research</strong> tasks to have the possibility to find a shiny Frillish.</p><p>The best way to get shiny Frilish during the Valentine's Day event in Pokemon GO is to<strong> hatch one from a 7km egg</strong>. Frillish has a much higher chance to be shiny if you hatch it from an egg rather than encountering one in the wild or doing research tasks. Of course, you can try to hatch eggs while doing these research tasks to further increase your odds of finding a shiny Frillish.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/2qTcliBkdQ2tt-IwTfnfNqnLcqX9oyo7hz8UfmwTOtk/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9kYW5pZWxfYm9yamFzLmpwZw alt="Daniel Borjas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3C8zqScpqeeYrSwe9KhoKexXZu%2FqrjLoqqh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

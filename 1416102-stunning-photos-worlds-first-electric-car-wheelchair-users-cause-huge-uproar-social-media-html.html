Ideal for e.g. driving to shop or doctor, when you need to get out of car just for getting in some building."I am just wondering why it is not already invented."<p class=align-left>Clive Hammon reacted:</p>"A great tool for mobility but where is it specifically designed for? If it's for the roads I would be very cautious about it's ability to withstand crashes."<p class=align-left>Abiodun Saheed Salako supported Hammon's reaction saying:</p>"My thoughts exactly. It seems they compromised on certain things. I'm curious about how durable it is. It's not meant for tough terrains. I think future designs will have more functionality and durability. This is commendable and has huge potential for the over 25 million disabled folks who use wheelchairs."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d2f96e9c8256ce40.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Photo shows expensive Tesla electric car trying to avoid big pothole in Lagos, Nigerians give funny reactions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Francis Mwale stated:</p>"Wow this amazing i like this."<p class=align-left>Ana G commented:</p>"I think this is excellent!!"<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Click “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Legit.ng News on your Facebook News Feed!</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> previously reported about the <a href=#>N1.9 million tiny car that is giving Elon Musk's Tesla 'headache' </a>in China.</p><p class=align-left>The video documentary which caused quite a stir also has it that the car can be charged with a normal 220V outlet as against that of other electric cars.</p><p class=align-left>The whip which performed well in the last quarter of 2020 than Tesla in China in terms of sales was created to help those that cannot afford expensive electric rides.</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Aljazeera</a> in a recent Twitter video publication, the tiny mini electric vehicle runs on a speed of 100km/h and a distance of 120-170km.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnV9lWpna2WjqcKvusinnmaomKTBsL%2BMsKarpJSoeqe10ayrZp2cmrC1vsicZJyZomLEqbHEpZqhmZmnera%2FxKuqZpuRqsCmeceunp5lpaW%2FsK3RZqqom5mWuW65xJ2gmmaYqbqt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

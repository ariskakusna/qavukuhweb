Marjorie immediately caught her future husband's eye, and during an appearance on his eponymous show in 2018, she recalled: <strong>"He was just staring at me… He finally realized, 'Oh, I gotta say something.' He was, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know who this is, but I'm gonna marry her.'"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c9756142255d-steve-harvey-kids-famous-family.jpg><p id=e_tw9wUpHGf data-wc=30>They briefly dated but it fizzled out.

In 2016, he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>: "He told me, 'Look, the only time I've ever seen you happy was when you were with that woman Marjorie. Now, before you go and do something stupid and marry another woman, I'm calling her.'"</p><p id=e85lMCFtEaln data-wc=39>It was undoubtedly the right decision, and he also told the outlet: "Marjorie changed the way I existed." He recalled: <strong>"It was like being reborn. I messed up so many times in my life. She made all the difference."</strong></p><p id=es8QeO7SvmAH data-wc=26>The two tied the knot on June 25, 2007, and earlier this summer, they celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary with a trip to Lake Como, Italy.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Who are Steve Harvey's kids?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/012d10203bee-gettyimages-168676883.jpg><p id=ec5G8tWz_3h7 data-wc=39>Steve and Marjorie have a blended family of seven.

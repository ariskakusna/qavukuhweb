The show is based on a true story. It follows a comedian who becomes alarmed when an admirer’s attentions grows obsessive and into stalking - and highlights how difficult it is to obtain a restraining order.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekt_pb28c0Y data-wc=83>The show also looks at Richard’s character Donny’s struggle with trauma, as a male mentor sexually assaulted him and is dealing with his feelings of confusion and shame. In one scene, he has made it to the finals of a comedy show where his stand-up falls flat, and he instead delivers a heartwrenching monologue about his experiences, including confessing to his relationship with a trans woman, Teri, that he had previously kept secret, being assaulted, and being stalked. But did this moment happen?&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Netflix’s Baby Reindeer is based on a true story</figure><p id=eVW4R-uve9V data-wc=69>In the monologue, he says: “I used to think genuinely, hear me out, I used to think that what you're seeing here is like breaking the mould. I'd watch these other comics rising above me and I never understood, why them but not me but then bam, reality smacks me in the face. I am so [expletive] naive. I was so naive in thinking that this was something special.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d112a1d52a42-br105unit00352rt.jpg><p id=e0j6mFbOe4D data-wc=100>“I was so naive in thinking that this was something special, that when a writer sweeps you off your feet and says, 'Hey, you've got it kid, let's make you famous,' you believe every word he's going to say to you because it's the words you wanted to hear your entire life, right? 'I believe in you, as much as you believe in yourself.’ So when this writer says he only works with wild ones and to face my fears, well, it's not long before I'm round his house taking boatloads of drugs every weekend, and isn't getting groomed magical?”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/75e9bae0d6a7-donny-baby-reindeer.jpg><p id=eLQRkPTEnU0 data-wc=78>Although there is no sign that Richard had a breakdown on stage in real life, moments from his stand-up that appear on the show are available to watch on YouTube, including a routine at the Chortle Student Comedy Award in 2012, where he made the same joke as in the show: “I know what you’re thinking. Venus Williams has let herself go.” However, the reception was much warmer than in the show, with Richard getting plenty of laughs.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer: who is Llewellyn Harrison?

The anti-comedy thing seems more apparent here,” while another person added: “This is it! The real-life scene from the movie.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8e002f9727ee-teri-donny-baby-reindeer.jpg><p id=e7Px0nhI0IDy data-wc=39>A third person added: “I just finished Baby Reindeer and I didn't expect his comedy to be this good omg!

It’s very weird, it’s very weird, it’s a very strange feeling, you only feel it on the inside. The outer powerlessness, the inner fire. Assault lasts for years – but people seem to think it’s an incident. People think ‘rape’ is the moment of penetration. But it lasts forever.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

The Coxes had threatened to move the boys' casket if Josh Powell were interred nearby.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Powell relatives had visited the Woodbine Cemetery and initially selected a plot near where 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden Powell are buried.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Josh Powell killed his sons and himself in a gas-fueled blaze on 5 February at a home he was renting in Graham. More than 1,000 mourners attended the boys' funeral Saturday. They were later buried in a single casket at Woodbine, a municipal cemetery in Puyallup.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Josh Powell was a suspect in Susan Powell's 2009 disappearance from their home in West Valley City, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Utah</a>. He had always claimed that he didn't know what happened to his wife. He took the boys – then two and four – on a midnight camping trip in freezing weather in the Utah desert, he said, and when he returned home the next day authorities were at the house looking for her.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Weeks later, he moved the boys to his father's home in Puyallup. After Steve Powell's arrest on voyeurism and child pornography charges last fall, the boys were removed from the house and turned over to the Coxes.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A social worker brought them to Josh Powell's rental home for what was supposed to be a court-sanctioned supervised visit. Josh Powell let the boys inside, locked the social worker out, hit them with a hatchet and set fire to gasoline, authorities said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A judge had recently ordered that Josh Powell undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation if he hoped to regain custody, and in a last-minute message to his sister he said he couldn't live without his boys.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpaGtnlpqvcH2VaKGoq5hivbDDxKWjrGWjpLu0ecGuqaKdlGKwprnErZyrsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

“I know the yearning,” Kidman said in a portion of the interview obtained by ET Canada."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tatler.com/article/nicole-kidman-tatler-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tatler class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tatler</a>, the actress revealed that her first pregnancy at 23 was ectopic, meaning that the fertilized egg was implanted outside the uterus.

It’s a huge, aching yearning. And the loss! The loss of a miscarriage is not talked about enough – that’s massive grief to certain women.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kidman and Cruise later adopted their children, Isabella and Connor. She has since had two biological children with her husband Keith Urban, whom she wed in 2006.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There’s an enormous amount of pain and an enormous amount of joy on the other side of it,” Kidman explained. “The flipside of going through so much yearning and pain to get there is the feeling of “Ahhhh!” when you have the child.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kidman previously spoke about her miscarriage during a November 2007 interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a934/nicole-kidman-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marie Claire" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Marie Claire</a>. “From the minute Tom and I were married, I wanted to have babies,” she said. “And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that ’s when it came that we would adopt Bella...My mother has an adopted sister, so it’s been part of our family and I knew it would probably play out somewhere in mine. I didn’t think it would happen so early but it did.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.

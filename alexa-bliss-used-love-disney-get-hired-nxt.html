Mind you my tryout, I had submitted a video. I was apparently the only person who submitted my own video to get the tryout and it was a casting call so there were all these models walking around and I texted my mom like, ‘Well I’m not making it.’ I texted my mom and I was like, ‘I’m five foot, these girls are Hollywood models walking around.’ They told us to do something to make us stand out and I remember thinking of American Idol people making themselves look like idiots so I wasn’t gonna do that.</p><p>So I was asked why I wanted to be in WWE and just to get the attention — because I was a fan too, you know what I mean? Like I walked in and I saw Triple H and I said, ‘Oh my god do you know you’re Triple H?!’ Oh that was me — totally me. I did that.</p><p>I remember these other girls in the tryout who walked in and didn’t know who he was and I almost had a heart attack — ‘Oh my god, you’re Triple H! Did you know you’re Triple H and you’re in the same room as me?!’… very embarrassing, but they asked me why I wanted to be in WWE. And to stand out I said, ‘I really want to be Tinker Bell at Disney and I’m hoping this gets my foot in the door.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX55e49xZmxoX5a5psTAZpmloaOoera%2FxJ1kpaemmnqltdKnnLJll5rBbrTIq5ydZZ6twXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

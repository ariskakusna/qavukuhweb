Brager's suggestion? Try placing the hair accessory in spot that doesn't seem so obvious. "Typically, you might be used to seeing a barrette at the back of the head, but more and more, the best placement is places where it might seem slightly imperfect," she says. "Just behind the ear, the temple area... if your hair is pulled back, you might put a barrette or clip just to the side of the ponytail. I love seeing barrettes in places you wouldn't typically see them. It adds a bang to your outfit instantly!"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-backcoming></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Backcoming</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After you pick where you'd like to place your barrette, Brager says to create a "pad" for the barrette by backcombing. But just backcombing isn't enough. In order to get that little "pad" to stick around, you have to set it in place with heat. Brager suggests using a tool like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>GrapheneMX Styling Iron by Bio Ionic</a>, which uses a Nobel Prize-winning technology called Graphene that conducts heat in a way that's not damaging to the hair. "Using the Stying Iron, tap the hair you just back combed," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Brie Larson Chopped Off All of Her Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-clip-back-the-correct-amount-of-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Clip Back the Correct Amount of Hair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So how exactly are you supposed to know how much hair to secure? The section of hair you're clipping back should coorespond to the width of the barrette. "If you have straight, fine hair, make sure to pick up at least the same width of the barrette, if not a bit more.Taking too little hair doesn't give a good enough base for the barrette or clip to successfully stay secured all day," she tells me.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-secure-secure-secure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Secure, Secure, Secure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simply clipping that section of hair in place is not enough, even if you did backcomb. Brager says to place a bobby pin just underneath where you want the barrette to sit to keep it in place, as well as spraying the secured barrette, and the hair around it, with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hairspray</a> or texture spray.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eYlrazecGaqaudpKmytHnToqes</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

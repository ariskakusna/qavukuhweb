Initially, we saw a snippet of the rehearsal footage from what would've been his iconic MJ routine.</p><p>Now, the Virginia native is keeping the hype going with a leak of a song he previously recorded which samples Jackson's "The Lady In My Life."</p><p>Titled "Transparency," Brown apparently has had issues, specifically with getting clearance for the track. Because of this, it lives in his personal archives, though he says he's asked about it on a regular basis.</p><p>"I know y'all been on me 'bout dis one," he previously wrote in the caption of an Instagram post from December 1st. In the accompanying video, the R&B star included a screen recording of two minutes of the unreleased song's audio – just enough to get his fans straightaway begging for a release date.</p><p>"(We couldn't clear the sample and we felt it took away from the song if that music wasn't there)," Breezy further explained. "Everybody and they momma ask me 'bout this damn song."</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Twitter users proved Brown right by hopping online to beg for the song's official debut. "Run him the damn clearance!!!" one person wrote.</p><p>Stream Chris Brown's leaked snippet of his "Transparency" track below.

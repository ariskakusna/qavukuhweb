Chris, who would not confirm or deny the reports, garnered one prize that might help him as a singleton, that of Most Sexy Man. His band snagged a pair of gongs, for album of the year and best album.</p><p id=eWKnStHbBbar data-wc=29>Meanwhile, the unexpected visit by Oasis' Noel resulted in a performance of <i>Wonderwall,</i> backed by a female string section, helping top off the group's victory as best UK band.</p><p id=eKqWPNa6hiDV data-wc=59>Single-name outfits swept the boards, with the Hives winning best international band, the Vines scooping best single and Doves taking home NME single of the year. Pop star Robbie Williams, who recently signed an £80-million deal with EMI, didn't fare so well, receiving the worst album and worst single awards as well as the tongue-in-cheek Villain Of The Year.</p><p id=e9lsLguIP7GP data-wc=79>Wildman Ozzy Osbourne had reason to celebrate, as his reality programme, <i>The Osbournes,</i> won best TV show, while the Black Sabbath front man himself won the impressive-sounding Hero Of The Year gong. It wasn't heroism, but prudent parenting, however that kept daughter Kelly from jetting in to perform at the London awards. "Sharon and Ozzy are concerned about their children's safety and they don't want them flying about while the world is on high alert," said the family's spokesperson.</p><p id=eKWuxSI6wTDK data-wc=22>Other winners of the night were best solo artist Ryan Adams, and teenage singer-songwriter Avril Lavinge, who was named Most Sexy Woman.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

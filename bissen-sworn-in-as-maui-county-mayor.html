When driving on the road these days, Mayor Richard Bissen says he “can’t quite explain why I have the occasional and sudden urge to pull off to the side of the road, stop my vehicle and get out and start waving at cars and people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In January 2022, he announced his plans to run for mayor, one of eight candidates in a packed primary that included then-incumbent Mayor Michael Victorino and then-Council Members Kelly King and Mike Molina.</p><img width=600 height=400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/01/03060336/mt-bissen-crowd-1-2-23.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Maui County Mayor Rick Bissen receives a standing ovation during Monday’s inauguration ceremony at the Castle Theater.</p><p>Victorino and Bissen advanced to the Nov. 8 general election, which Bissen won with 31,381 votes, or 59.7 percent, to Victorino’s 19,724 votes, or 37.6 percent. The two mounted massive campaigning efforts that totaled nearly $1.3 million combined, with Bissen pulling in $723,102.91 and Victorino raising $562,934.16 during the election period, according to campaign spending reports filed Dec. 8.</p><p>On Monday evening, Bissen thanked both the former mayor, who was on the Mainland and couldn’t attend the inauguration, as well as his wife, Joycelyn Victorino, who was in attendance.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I just want to say how gracious he and Mrs. Victorino have been to me and my family during this time with his actions and his words, and again, I extend a mahalo to Mayor Victorino,”</span> Bissen said.</p><p>During the campaign, Bissen said he traveled to 11 communities throughout Lanai, Molokai and Maui, listening to the stories and challenges of each neighborhood.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I felt honored that people shared their stories with me, stories of success, struggles, hope,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“You know, we face challenges and opportunities so important and so complex that it will take a collective willingness and commitment from all of us to work together through them. It will require compromise and mutual respect and servant leadership, striving to carry forward a positive impact for our future generations.”</span></p><img width=600 height=467 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/01/03060345/mt-lingle-etc-1-2-23.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Hawaii Lt.

My team and I will focus on what’s best for the people of Maui, Molokai and Lanai,”</span> he said. “Now I feel like it was important to point out, because all too often we become polarized and we lose sight of our purpose in government. We cannot lose that focus even when people do not agree with our decisions.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We’re fortunate to be trusted enough to be able to serve our people and our community,”</span> he added. <span class=quotations>“Every situation and every decision is unique, and perfect decisions that meet everyone’s expectations cannot be guaranteed. But we can learn and we can get better.”</span></p><p>Bissen said his administration plans to put <span class=quotations>“heightened attention”</span> on the issues he’s been discussing on the campaign trail — kamaaina housing, <span class=quotations>“adequate resources that meet the needs for many, not just some,”</span> protection of the environment, responsible planning and good governance. He also pointed to issues of climate change, food sovereignty and renewable energy, adding that his administration has established a new Office of Innovation <span class=quotations>“to ensure we are making advances in those critical areas.”</span></p><p>When it comes to tackling issues, Bissen emphasized cooperation and working through differences together.</p><p><span class=quotations>“You know, we like to talk about having a seat at the table for everyone,”</span> he said. “Oftentimes it may not even be a table at all, but maybe a simple lauhala mat, carried to and rolled out to wherever it needs to be. So I’m committed to bringing that lauhala mat to our communities, to our government partners, to our business sector, our nonprofits, our community leaders and their organizations.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Together we’ll work hard on the things we can agree on to help our people in any way we can.”</span></p><p>* Colleen Uechi can be reached at cuechi@mauinews.com.</p><a href=#><img width=450 height=300 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/01/03060336/mt-bissen-crowd-1-2-23-450x300.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-1058090 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Maui County Mayor Rick Bissen receives a standing ovation during Monday’s inauguration ceremony at the Castle Theater. <a href=#><img width=420 height=300 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/01/03060343/mt-bissen-inaugurate-1-2-23-420x300.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-1058091 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen is sworn in by former 2nd Circuit Court Chief Judge Joseph Cardoza as wife Isabella Ka‘ihikapulani Bissen looks on Monday evening at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater.

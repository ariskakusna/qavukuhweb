The 2002 tape was released online by The Daily Mail, which wrote that the video was hidden for decades by casting director Matthew Barry and noted there was an eBay listing in 2021 offering the tape for $1 million."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the book, she discussed losing the Notebook role.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Even though it would have been fun to reconnect with Ryan Gosling after our time on the&nbsp;Mickey Mouse Club,&nbsp;I’m glad I didn’t do it,” she said <a href=# rel=nofollow>according to People</a>. “I imagine there are people in the acting field who have dealt with something like that, where they had trouble separating themselves from a character. I hope I never get close to that occupational hazard again. Living that way, being half yourself and half a fictional character, is messed up. After a while you don’t know what’s real anymore.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Notebook was based on Nicholas Sparks’ 1996 novel about a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s, while their romance is framed by the couple in their twilight years while one of them suffers from Alzheimer’s. The film was directed by&nbsp;Nick Cassavetes and grossed $115 million worldwide.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spears had previously starred in 2002’s coming-of-age dramedy Crossroads, a film that was lambasted by critics.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spears’ new memoir, which comes out Oct. 24, will tell her story of a decades-long career, growing up in entertainment, her various personal relationships and her 13-year conservatorship, which ended in November 2021. Among other revelations in Spears’ book is that <a href=#>she had an abortion</a> while she was in a relationship with fellow singer&nbsp;<a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>, calling it “one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Notebook’s studio New Line had no immediate comment on the tape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKO%2ByK2lnrFdqL2mrdGsZK2glWK7sMDEm6aoo12WwqW106Kmp2WmnrGmu4xqaWxtZmeBen2VaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

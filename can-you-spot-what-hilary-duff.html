Hilary got porcelain veneers, which are not only brighter white than her God-given set but also are larger and more symmetrical along their bottom ridges. Back when she got them, the press gave her a lot of crap, saying they looked like 'horse teeth'; there have been rumors that she's since had them filed-down to look more natural. Either way, my vote is that her smile looks gorgeous the way it is now. Do you agree or think her 'before' teeth were more flattering? For what it's worth, she said the reason for getting veneers was that she was always chipping her weak teeth on microphones. I dunno...I wish celebs wouldn't offer excuses for cosmetic procedures. It's OK, your job is to look hot—we get it! And while I love when stars embrace their quirky teeth, I don't see anything wrong with fixing them if it's something they feel passionately about.</p><p>What do you think? Are you sick of generic Hollywood smiles? Have any of you gotten a major smile makeover? Do any of you wish you could afford to get veneers? Would you be nervous because they're permanent? How much do you guys spend on power-bleaching and Whitestrips? Is your smile a big part of your beauty routine?</p><p>Photos: Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FfmK6vediorGaroKTBbsPHmqtmoJmhrrPFjJ2sn54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

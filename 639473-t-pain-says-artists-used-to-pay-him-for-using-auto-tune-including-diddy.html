Pain explained that the song didn’t have the effect Jay thought it would, especially with the new crop of artists. Drama then asked Pain to confirm the rumors that he got paid every time someone used auto-tune. T-Pain confirmed it was true, revealing that several artists wrote him a check back in the day, such as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“It was nuts, it was real crazy,” he said of that point of his career. “Some people volunteered and some people didn’t know, so that was great. Diddy volunteered. Diddy gave me points on Last Train To Paris ’cause he used Auto-Tune.” Pain added that there’s video evidence on a hard drive of Diddy “writing a contract on a napkin in the studio saying he was gonna give me a point on Last Train To Paris.” Hopefully, that video emerges in the near future.

Marshall had adopted two dogs a while ago and reportedly gave one to Peppers to look after over the semester.</p><p>When it came to returning the dog, Peppers thought it was hers and so it looks like there was confusion over who owned the dog from then on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>HOW DID I MISS THIS FALLING OUT BETWEEN LADARIUS AND MONICA I- üò≤ <a href=#>#CheerNetflix</a></p>‚Äî Valerie is watching CHEER S2 (@billybob99CP) <a href=#>January 12, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=whats-ladarius-doing-now>What‚Äôs La‚ÄôDarius doing now?</h2><p>Since leaving Navarro, La‚ÄôDarius has moved back to Florida where he is following in Aldama‚Äôs footsteps and is currently training young athletes at Cheer Athletics in Pensacola.</p><p>Through scrolling his Instagram, Marshall appears happy with his new start back home and not only has he been supportive of the new season of the show, but he has also mended his relationship with Aldama.</p><p>The pair sat down while they were both in Daytona for the national championships and discussed their issues.</p><p>Aldama asked Marshall if he genuinely meant what he said about her being abusive, and he told her he didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhen I think of our relationship, I see you how you see me, I see you as my mom.

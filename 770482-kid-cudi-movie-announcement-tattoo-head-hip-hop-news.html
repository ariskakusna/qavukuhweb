Moreover, he recently shared plans with fans for his two upcoming films. "I got the music outta me," the Cleveland creative shared on Twitter on Saturday (March 2). "I got a lot of other stuff im workin on that im really excited about. HELL NAW, the film im doing at Sony and writing w the Lucas Bros is comin together beautifully. S**t is madddd funny and ridiculous. Cant wait for yall to see this madness. And lookin to shoot my directorial debut, TEDDY, sometime after tour."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not only that, but the 40-year-old has previously announced that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he'll focus on film for the next few years and eschew new music</a>. "My next album is already about 80% done, and itll be out in 2026," Kid Cudi expressed on Twitter. "As always, were takin it someplace new. Just wanted to let yall know, expect an album from me every other year.&nbsp;next year is all about filmin. Got a bunch of stuff I need to get done. Film and tv. So I take a year off of music to do it all."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kid-cudi-hypes-up-two-upcoming-movies>Kid Cudi Hypes Up Two Upcoming Movies</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, Kid Cudi also made a big creative leap, but not in music or movies. Instead, he shared a new floral head tattoo that he got all around his skull. Back to the movies, though, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Hell Naw</a> is a zombie horror comedy co-written by the brothers behind Judas & The Black Messiah. "Sam, The Lucas Brothers and myself have really crafted a tale we feel everyone who’s a fan of horror and comedy will enjoy," he told Deadline. "You will laugh, oh yes you will, but the horror aspect of this movie will really be something to see. You will be shook. I promise. Y’all know I don’t play around."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cudi-s-new-tattoo>Cudi's New Tattoo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Teddy</a> will be a more personal movie based on the "ELECTROWAVEBABY" creative's 2009 hit "Pursuit of Happiness." <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> and Jeymes Samuel, also of Judas & The Black Messiah, are executive producing the comedy. "I added a lot of my own personal struggles and experiences in it, so this film is very close to my heart,” he stated online in 2022. “I know that, deep down, this movie will help people the same ways music has… It’s trippy, it’s fun, it’s sad, it’s life."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbH11hJFmoqKcXZjCpbWMpqavoZVirq%2B6zq6lnJ2dmru1edOaq62nn2K1pq3DZp%2BiqF2dvLF5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

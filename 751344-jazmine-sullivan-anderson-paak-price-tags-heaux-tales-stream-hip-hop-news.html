Moreover, it has a lot of smooth, emotive, soulful, and musically proficient highlights, plus some notable collaborations with the likes of H.E.R. and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ari Lennox</a>. However, perhaps none rank greater than her link-up with the one and only <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Anderson .Paak</a> on "Price Tags," which is one of the more thematically consistent cuts on the record. On it, the 36-year-old talks about wealth, material success, sexual empowerment, and relationship dynamics. It's a pretty versatile song when looking at these themes, but most importantly, it's an infectiously groovy jam with a lot of lush instrumentation and catchy melodies.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Jairus "J-Mo" Mozee put together a pretty impressive production from behind the board, highlighting both featured artists' talents. The crisp and simple drum beat is consistently nasty, and offers some funky and stark contrast from the traditionally lavish backing elements. These include an ear-worm, high-pitch key sample, vocal harmonies, light guitar strums, and cavernous bass. Jazmine Sullivan shines with a dynamic performance, and the "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Stand Up</a>" singer shows off her range from soaring cries to sultry temptations. On his end, Anderson .Paak proves himself as one of the most charismatic vocalists working today with a sassy and impassioned verse.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jazmine-sullivan-s-price-tags-with-anderson-paak-stream>Jazmine Sullivan's "Price Tags" With Anderson .Paak: Stream</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, this follows a successful but sometimes turbulent 2023 for the Philly native, who <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">had her set canceled</a> at the Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival due to a stampede. Hopefully 2024 brings Jazmine Sullivan more luck, and finally brings the return of NxWorries that Anderson .Paak's been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teasing for so long</a>. As we look forward to what these stars will do this year, we have this throwback to remind us of their talent and skill. If you've never heard "Price Tags" before, find it and the rest of Heaux Tales on your preferred streaming service and peep some notable lines down below.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan50gJNmoZqynZ67pnnSrqOloaaWu26tzZ2cq6ufo3qxrcCkZKmqmZiybsDAoKpmoJWWwrl505qjnqtdqMGzscCmZKGhoGK1sLyMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

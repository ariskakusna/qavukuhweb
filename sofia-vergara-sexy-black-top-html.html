By Jonathan Klotz | Published 1 year ago When it comes to fashion and beauty, sometimes less is more, and that holds true even for one of the most beautiful women in the world. As an example is a pair of recent photos shared by Modern Family star Sofia Vergara of her Valentine’s celebration with her husband, Magic Mike’s Joe Manganiello."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As an example is a pair of recent photos shared by Modern Family star Sofia Vergara of her Valentine’s celebration with her husband, <a href=#>Magic Mike’s</a> Joe Manganiello. The power couple frequently share images, both cute and sexy, onto their <a href=#>Instagram</a> accounts.</p><p>The Columbian beauty looks stunning in just a simple, low-cut black dress accented by a gorgeous golden necklace. If Sofia Vergara is wearing matching earrings, we can’t tell from underneath her long, straight locks. For his part, Joe Manganiello looks handsome as well, sporting a fresh haircut going by his own social media and a tasteful dash of grey in his goatee.</p><p>Taken from what appears to be a restaurant, the selfies can’t help but show Sofia Vergara’s good side. It’s just nice to see world famous actors still celebrating the romantic holiday like the rest of us: trying hard to not catch other patrons in our photos. This is of course, just a few weeks after the pair had a <a href=#>tropical vacation</a>, which of course, included a sexy bikini.</p><p>Both of the gorgeous stars have more going on beyond their incredible good looks. Sofia Vergara is an award-winning comedic actress as part of the Modern Family ensemble alongside <a href=#>Ariel Winter</a>, Ty Burrell, Ed O’Neil, Julie Bowen, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet, Sarah Hyland, and Rico Rodriguez. Airing for 250 episodes, it reached the point where the stars of other shows were just waiting for Modern Family to stop airing so that other shows could start being awarded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sofia-vergara-snl-black-dress-3-900x506.jpg><p>Sofia Vergara isn’t the only award-winner, Joe Manganiello won a Scream award for his role as the werewolf Alcide in True Blood. Soothing the pain from supporting Pittsburgh’s sport teams, the Smurfs: The Lost Village star also received a prestigious Mid-Atlantic Emmy for narrating Pittsburgh is Home: The Story of the Penguins. A noted soccer fan Vergara expresses her fandom a little differently, by owning a line of athletic wear.</p><p>As other stars have done before her, Sofia Vergara went from modeling to owning her fashion line. <a href=#>Sofia Jeans</a> encompasses a summer line, active wear, and casual wear. While this is not a high-end fashion along the lines of Elizabeth Hurley’s swimwear collection, Sofia Jeans have been a huge hit at Wal-Mart and helped keep Vergara one of the richest actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>In a rare dramatic role, Sofia Vergara can be seen later this year as Griselda Blanco in a Netflix series. The miniseries is based on the real-life criminal mastermind at the head of the 80s and early 90s cocaine trafficking operations in Miami and New York. Developed by the same creative team behind the hit series Narcos, Griselda is poised to be one of this year’s massive hits for the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> giant. As her husband, Manganiello makes up for his horrible choice of sports fandom by being a huge nerd, he’s currently working on a Dungeons and Dragons documentary set for the game’s 50th anniversary in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno6Szqq2Mr5yrn5Gnrm6%2FxLGwZpqclrCsedOop2egpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

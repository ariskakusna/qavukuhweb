Despite going their separate ways, the two have&nbsp;kept in touch and continued to support one another in their personal lives and respective careers — including their endeavors outside of acting. In fact, when Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California in 2003, Hamilton was there to support him at his inauguration, she revealed in an interview on <a href=#>"Jimmy Kimmel Live"</a>&nbsp;in 2019. "He's just become the greatest elder statesman," said Hamilton of her co-star. "You know, he's an amazing mind and agenda and I have just developed so much respect for him."</p><p>In a separate chat with&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, Hamilton reflected on her solid partnership with&nbsp;Schwarzenegger more than three decades since they first worked together. "I loved working with Arnold. I actually was just pleased as punch when I saw him again. It had been a number of years," the "Beauty and the Beast" actor said. "And I just have this affection for him that is so deep and biting." Similarly, Schwarzenegger has sung Hamilton's praises on several occasions, such as his touching birthday tribute in 2018. "Happy birthday to my dear friend Linda Hamilton. One of my favorite co-stars, a true badass, and a wonderful human being," he <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtgaIF0hI6aqaennJl6tK%2FHsJirspWjsqizxKtkpaGema5utMCmoKWsn6N6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

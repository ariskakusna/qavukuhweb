And, though it didn’t work out with that Taylor, Lautner actually married another Taylor—Taylor Dome Lautner—and the couple celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Saturday. Lautner said of his wife, tying it all together with a bow, that she is a “diehard Swiftie.”</p><p>Lautner said his wife “let me know that I’m the only ex without a disk track now,” he said. “So that sounds like a nice thing. I’ll take it and run. No complaints here.” Taylor Dome Lautner (it’s getting confusing over here in Taylorland) said of Swift and Lautner “In my mind they’re not even exes.” Her husband added that Swift is “our friend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saJeSrmgxXaiaxNcdNbGPD-1920-80.jpg><p>Back in July, Swift surprised fans by bringing Lautner out onstage during her Eras Tour stop in Kansas City. (The same show where Kelce was in the audience, wanting to give her his number backstage but not being able to do so. Insert Twilight Zone music here.) While onstage, Lautner cartwheeled and did a backflip, in homage to a scene he shared with Swift in Valentine’s Day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6bjScu6N2EzVfDFLEaApi7-1920-80.jpg><p>“I’ve been in front of a lot of people before, but I’ve never been in front of 75,000 Swifties before,” he recalled of his appearance at the Eras Tour. “And it’s a different level of passion. So that was just pretty surreal.”</p><p>Lautner is no stranger to rabid fanbases—he did, after all, star in the Twilight franchise: “Twilight fans are definitely insanely passionate themselves,” he said. “So I had experienced a taste of that, [but] never 75,000 of them at once. And obviously what Taylor’s doing right now in her career is just unheard of. So, similar, but this was definitely up there. It’s a very, very cool experience.”&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

And that’s the greatest part about her, in my opinion.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiska65sL6MpZiurJ6av266wKacnWWklsatu9FmqrChlql6o7HSrWSesF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

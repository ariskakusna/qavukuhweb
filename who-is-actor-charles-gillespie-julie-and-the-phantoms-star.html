The actor — who plays Luke in the musical series about a ghostly boyband that comes back to life &nbsp;— stole viewers’ hearts the second he started singing “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edge of Great</a>.”</p><p>The actor first stepped into the spotlight in 2014 with a role in&nbsp;The Outlaw League. When it came to nabbing his&nbsp;Julie and the Phantoms role years later, Charles revealed that the script gave him “butterflies.”</p><p>“I think every actor feels that once in a while you’ll read a script and you’ll be done reading it, and there’s butterflies that’ll stick around with you,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;during an interview published on September 16. “It’s something that just struck with your values, that you can relate with and I was definitely there. When I went to the end of the first episode, the relationship between the Phantoms and Julie, I could just tell that these two groups were going to be absolutely amazing friends.”</p><p>While the show hasn’t officially been <a href=#>renewed for a second season</a> just yet, that hasn’t stopped Charles from sharing his hopes for more episodes of the show.</p><p>“I really hope that if we do get a season 2, to let my superpowers grow,” the actor also told&nbsp;ET, noting that he hopes for more between his character and Julie (played by <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Reyes</a></strong>). “He’s smitten about her, I can guarantee you. But they’re ghosts, so it’s impossible because I don’t know, he’s dead.”</p><p></p><p>Charles continued, “It’s hard because he’s a ghost and she’s a girl. I think what’s so beautiful about season 1 is you know it’s there, the energy is there, the chemistry is there but there are very specific moments where my character figures it out, there’s a specific moment where her character figures it out and they became best friends. They write music together you know? And so, I think it’s a great message for people to realize — make sure you’re best friends with somebody before you continue, before we really ask that question on the show. So I’m excited to see what the [writers] have in mind for what’s next.”</p><p>To celebrate Charles’ breakout role,&nbsp;J-14&nbsp;decided to investigate and find out everything you need to know about The Hollywood heartthrob.

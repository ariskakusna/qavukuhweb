She said, "I think it looks hot," acknowledging that "the girls like it." She claimed she was not bothered by his female fans, insisting, "I mean, I like to scream along, too."&nbsp;But in 2010,&nbsp;she told&nbsp;<a href=#>Glamour</a> she "used to" have "moments of jealousy"&nbsp;in their relationship.</p><p>Hudgens was even more honest in a 2015&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a>&nbsp;interview, five years after her split from Efron. She confessed, "I went through a phase when I was really mean because I was so fed up." She admitted, "Girls were running after him, and I was giving them death stares." With time, her perspective changed and she revealed that she reminded herself, "Spread the love, be a good person, they support you, be nice."</p><p>In that 2007&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;interview, Efron was asked about the silver band he was wearing on his ring finger. He teased,&nbsp;"This is just a ring from a friend that I got. 'Commitment' is way too weird a word for me right now." Of course, people assumed it was from Hudgens, especially since he admitted a "female friend"&nbsp;got it for him.</p><p>Hudgens brushed off the marriage speculation during a 2009&nbsp;People&nbsp;interview, sharing, "I think [marriage and starting a family] is great, but I'm so focused on my career right now that it doesn't really cross my mind."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhiaIN2e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2vrqR5xJ%2BpqKZdlruledWapZ6ro5Z6qcHDoJynq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

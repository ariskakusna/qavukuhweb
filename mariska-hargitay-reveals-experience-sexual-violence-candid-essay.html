They were the first ones to call it what it was. They were gentle and kind and careful, but their naming it was important. It wasn't a confrontation, like 'You need to deal with what happened,' it was more like looking at it in the light of day: 'Here is what it means when someone rapes another person, so on your own time, it could be useful to compare that to what was done to you.'"</p><p id=euHs_h2990kj data-wc=66>She ultimately declared: "Now I'm able to see clearly what was done to me. I understand the neurobiology of trauma. Trauma fractures our mind and our memory. The way a mirror fractures," adding: "That's why I've talked so much about acquaintance rape, because many people still think of rape as a man jumping out of the bushes. This was a friend who made a unilateral decision."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eGcU73pNIpqB data-wc=62>Mariska continues to be a steadfast advocate for survivors and efforts to end sexual violence, and further wrote: "I want this violence to end. Sexual violence persists not because of something unchangeable in our human condition, it exists because power structures are in place that allow it to happen. Those power structures are so pervasive that no one is immune from them."</p><p id=e22RGkq7rLt- data-wc=45>She maintained: "As for justice, it's important to know that it may look different for each survivor. <strong>For me, I want an acknowledgment and an apology</strong>. 'I'm sorry for what I did to you. I raped you. I am without excuse.'

AT&T has had a rather strange life.&nbsp; The first version of AT&T, which was founded in 1885, was split into the seven "<a href=#>Baby Bell</a>s", smaller corporations that controlled telecommunications in particular regions around the US, in 1983.&nbsp; The former AT&T, also known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, had virtually monopolized the phone market, and the U.S. Government ordered the company to break-up.&nbsp; The Southwestern Bell Corporation was one of the seven "<a href=#>Baby Bell</a>s", and the Bell that received the majority of AT&T's ownership rights.&nbsp; The company began to develop cellular and mobile communications, in addition to their landline service, and began buying up smaller companies that were related to telecommunications development and innovation.&nbsp; This continued until the early 2000s, at which point Southwestern Bell Corporation, now known as SBC Communications, Inc., was quite large.&nbsp; In 2002, SBC purchased their original parent company, AT&T, for $16 billion.&nbsp; It took almost a year for the merger to go through, at which point the company became known as AT&T again.&nbsp; They then bought up BellSouth, which was valued at $86 billion.&nbsp; Since then, the company has continued to grow, and has focused the majority of its development on new technology and mobile communications.&nbsp; AT&T is the largest landline provider in the US, and second in mobile provision.&nbsp; The company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and currently employs 256,420 people.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeRqXpxf5dmq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mamFngXJ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

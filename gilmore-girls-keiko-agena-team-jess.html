They loved challenging each other and the friction of that was so fun to watch."</p><p>Jess Mariano was portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia, and counts many die-hard supporters among fans of the show. Rory's other main boyfriends on the show were Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry), who is often seen as the least controversial of her love interests, and Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki), who is the most controversial of the lot.</p><p>Agena further explained why she loved the romance between Jess and Rory, telling E! News, "Because you can grow in the other ways. I think maturity wise, we all had to grow. They were young when they met. But having that fiery interest where you can always talk about things and grow together. I feel like that's the bedrock of a good relationship."</p><p>As the outlet points out, Agena knows a little something about solid relationships, having been married to the musician Shin Kawasaki for 18 years.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

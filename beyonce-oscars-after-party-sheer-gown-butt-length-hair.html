Bey showed off her jaw-dropping dress, designed by <a href=#>Celia Kritharioti</a>, which was made of totally see-through mesh fabric with strategically placed beading. The underboob- and butt-baring gown had one sleeve and the highest leg slit, ever, that went all the way up past her hip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She accessorized with a blingy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tiffany & Co.</a> diamond choker that looked as if it could've been a part of the dress, as well as stud earrings, a silver sparkly clutch, matching PVC heels, and thin metal sunglasses. She wore her hair in long, bouncy curls that reached the bottom of her back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the first image, the Destiny's Child alum held up a bedazzled sheer veil in front of her that also hung off her head in later slides. Several close-up snaps showed the dress' intricate detailing, while the carousel's last photo caught Beyoncé from behind as she looked over her shoulder. There was also a GIF of Jay Z with his arm around her as she through up peace and OK signs. Like many of the artist's posts, this one was also without a caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hip-hop couple's after-party sparked a lot of backlash. The husband-and-wife duo held the soirée at the historic Los Angeles landmark hotel Chateau Marmont, which has recently come under fire due to allegations of employee mistreatment, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. Despite a workers' boycott, the industry's biggest names still turned out for the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8GesKimk5p6rLrOsKOeq1%2BXsrq7zZycZqejmK6zv4yana2domK9or7TsmSsoJWav26zzrClZpqlqcFuuMSnnq2gXZ2uqr4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

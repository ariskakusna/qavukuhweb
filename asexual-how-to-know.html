JENN,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I am in my 20s and have only had two boyfriends. I feel romantically connected to the men I have dated in the past — but I don't find myself feeling turned on or wanting to have sex. I do want to fall in love and get married one day but I just don't have an interest in sex. Could I be asexual? — Just Not That Into It</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>DEAR NOT INTO IT,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many people, like you, just do not feel sexually drawn to others. The Asexuality Visibility and Education Network, the most well-known asexuality organization, describes asexuality as follows: "An asexual person does not experience sexual attraction — they are not drawn to people sexually and do not desire to act upon attraction to others in a sexual way." While asexual people — also known as "Ace" or "Aces" – may have little interest in having sex, most desire emotionally intimate relationships. (Which sounds like you!)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When determining whether you fit into that community, it's important to note that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>asexuality is different than celibacy</a>. While it is controversial, many people consider asexuality to be an orientation (what you are or are not sexually attracted to), whereas celibacy is a behavioral choice (not having sex). Someone may choose to be celibate for religious reasons or personal reasons (e.g. they want to save themselves for marriage). Someone who is asexual, however, is not sexually attracted to another person and does not want to engage in sexual acts. It's not a fleeting state. An article on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Pride.com</a> put it pretty clearly: "If you're offended when people say being gay, lesbian, or bi is a choice, then you can't just say the same thing about asexuals."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Asexual people experience different kinds of attraction.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Someone who is asexual may feel drawn to another person, and date them for reasons that are not sexual. Asexual people experience different kinds of attraction. <strong>Here's how these might look in your daily life:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Romantic attraction: </strong>I would love to go for a walk on the beach and share a sunset with that person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Aesthetic attraction: </strong>I can really appreciate how attractive that person is, just the way I can appreciate a beautiful piece of art but not have a desire to touch it or take it home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sensual attraction: </strong>I would love to cuddle, hug, kiss or hold hands with this person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How do you know whom you want to share these romantic, aesthetic, or sensual experiences with? That is how people within the asexual community identify their sexual orientation. Here are some of the common categories they use to differentiate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Aromantic: </strong>a lack of romantic attraction towards anyone</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Biromantic: </strong>romantic attraction towards either sex</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Heteromantic: </strong>romantic attraction towards the opposite sex</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Homoromantic: </strong>romantic attraction towards the same sex</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Panromantic: </strong>romantic attraction not limited with regard to gender or gender identity</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Being asexual isn't a medical concern.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's important to know that most people who are asexual have always felt that way. It isn't a medical concern that needs fixing and it's not the same as loss of libido, sexual dysfunction or a fear of intimacy. It is also different from conditions such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder</a>, a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity that causes distress and relationship difficulty. This is not the case for people who identify as being asexual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, if this lack of sexual desire is new for you, it is important to rule out any medical or emotional issues that may have shifted your feelings. Make sure to get a physical, meet with your gynecologist to get an exam, have your hormones tested, and get a full blood panel. If this change is emotional, it is especially important to meet with a psychotherapist or sex therapist to discuss why the sudden shift in libido. A history of trauma, depression, anxiety, or struggles with intimacy issues can cause a person to turn off sexually. Again, any of these medical or emotional issues are different than asexuality.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>So, can asexual people have romantic relationships... or sex?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are many different ways to be in a relationship if you are asexual. There are some people who choose to not have any sexual contact at all. There are some asexual people who are in relationships with sexual people who opt to have an open relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are others who opt to have sexual experiences with their partner for a range of reasons, like making their partner happy, or showing and receiving affection. Remember: Asexuality doesn't mean that someone can't enjoy sex — it just means they don't experience sexual attraction. That means some asexual people choose to have sex for the physical or sensual pleasure, including touching and cuddling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bottom line is every asexual person is different in their desire to have sex. Some aces might be repulsed by it, while others may enjoy it. As a person who identified as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Queenieofaces on Tumblr</a> said, "We need to recognize that for some people, sex is great and for some it is horrific and for some, it is on a par with folding laundry." If it is positive or neutral, having sexual contact can be okay for someone who is asexual. If it is unpleasant or negative, that can be unhealthy and create resentment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the day, whether you're asexual or any other sexual orientation, what matters is that you have good communication and talk through any challenges with anyone you date.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Hump Day, award-winning psychotherapist and TV host Dr. Jenn Mann answers your sex and relationship questions — unjudged and unfiltered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eupKlllJbGcK3Snq%2BumZxitbDDjK2mZqOepMQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The incident came at the worst possible timing for the Aussie, who was leading 4-2 against Britain’s Katie Boulter in the first set tie-break when play was disrupted.
The protester, a member of the Just Stop Oil group, was hauled away by security and bizarrely given medical treatment court-side as both players helped clean up the mess."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was like ‘Oh, my God, why on my court out of all of them?’ and I’m the worst with being able to refocus.”</p><p>Earlier, protesters from the same group disrupted a match between Sho Shimabukuro and Grigor Dimitrov at around 2pm London time (11pm AEST).</p><p>Protesters threw orange coloured confetti and jigsaw pieces onto the court and then sat on the grass.</p><p>Play was briefly suspended while they were removed and staff picked up the mess.</p><p>Two men and a woman, all wearing T-shirts with “Just Stop Oil” printed on them, were later arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and criminal damage.</p><p>The fact the protest occurred at all will be an embarrassment to Wimbledon officials who had been checking all bags with airport style security to get into the venue.</p><p>“Every year we work with the Metropolitan Police and other agencies in planning for the Championships,” chief executive Sally Bolton told the<a class=body-link href=# title=www.bbc.com> BBC</a> in April.</p><p>“Our arrangements for security are planned around those and that is an ever-changing environment.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Our grounds conditions that apply to everyone are very much about the safety and security of everyone attending, but more importantly the enjoyment of everyone attending.”</p><p>Last week, three members of Just Stop Oil were arrested at Lord’s cricket ground on day one of The Ashes second test.</p><p>They also brought London’s LGBTI Pride parade to a standstill on Saturday by sitting down in front of a Coca-Cola float.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfqbKvusisZpynpafBbrXNr5isoZ%2Bjeqe%2BzqZko62jqXq0wM6pZKihnGK9s7vTnqqtZZenvLa8jJqrZq%2BZoq%2BtscOopWimlazAbr%2FTqKmyZ2aYfnN%2FlZ1ta21lZa94sJSanWxtZGyzdH%2BQcJmebGGY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

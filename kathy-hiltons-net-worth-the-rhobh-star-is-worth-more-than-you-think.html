In the '80s and '90s, she ran an antique shop called The Staircase on Sunset Plaza, and in 2002, she began selling household items and skincare products on QVC and HSN. "Kathy likes selling," Rick told <a href=#>The Wall Street Journal</a>, "so she would dominate." And Rick was right, as she sold out of some products after her first on-air appearance.</p><p dir=ltr>But Rick is not the only one to commend Kathy's business acumen.

She understands the realities of what many women can spend on evening wear."</p><p dir=ltr>The Oklahoman reported that Kathy "also has her eye on bedding, furniture, costume jewelry and more," and with increased exposure from <a href=#>The Real Housewives</a>, the time may be ripe for her to embark on a new entrepreneurial adventure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBhaYF0e8qaq6GxXZ22rcDOp6pmppWperi70a2fZqyYmnqztM6bn2arpJa%2FbrXSZq6oqqSdeq670Z5kraCRo3q6u9Rmq6GhnqB8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

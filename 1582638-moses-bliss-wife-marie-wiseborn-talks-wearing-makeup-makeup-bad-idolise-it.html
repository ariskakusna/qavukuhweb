It's bad when you make it an idol. It is bad when you make it your all and all. I don't think makeup is demonic, but I'm saying that there are some makeup brands and pallette that I stay away from. Firstly, I believe that names carry power because when you read the bible and they name somebody or something, it is important. I saw an eye shadow palette, and there was one called Jezebel. I said oh, I won't use it again. And there were ones like Lust and Seduction, and I said no, we are not doing this today.In saying that, we should be mindful of that because I believe names carry power, so you will name something Jezebel unless you know something is up. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/90f4f1ef2f03d91d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BBNaija's Uriel laments high cost of makeup, installing hair, netizens react: "It will still shift"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Watch the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> below;</p><h2>Moses Bliss and Marie Wiseborn rock elegant kente for their traditional wedding</h2><p class=align-left>Celebrity couple Moses Bliss and Marie Wiseborn looked stunning together in beautiful kente ensembles for the traditional wedding in Ghana.

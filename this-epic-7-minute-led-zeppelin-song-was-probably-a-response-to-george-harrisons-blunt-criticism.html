Instead of focusing on anthemic rockers, "Houses of the Holy" saw the band expanding their musical palette in a variety of ways and recording slower, gentler tracks like "The Rain Song." This was not, by any means, their first ballad, but at 7 minutes and 39 seconds, it was only second to "Stairway to Heaven"&nbsp;as Zep's longest song at that point in their career. And of course, Led Zeppelin was simply not known for their love ballads.&nbsp;</p><p>As quoted by <a href=#>Far Out Magazine</a>, Brad Tolinski wrote in his book, "Light & Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page," that the inspiration for "The Rain Song" supposedly came from a conversation Zeppelin drummer John&nbsp;Bonham had with George Harrison, who was then at the height of his solo career.&nbsp;"George was talking to Bonzo one evening and said, 'The problem with you guys is that you never do ballads,'" Page recalled to Tolinski. "I said, 'I'll give him a ballad,' and I wrote 'Rain Song,' which appears on Houses of the Holy. In fact, you'll notice I even quote 'Something' in the song's first two chords."</p><p>Indeed, there are some subtle similarities between the intros of "The Rain Song" and the Beatles' "Something," and as Far Out speculated, it's possible that Page co-wrote "The Rain Song" as a "pastiche" of Harrison's brand of guitar-driven love songs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlnBnbWhfqbWqv4yep6KbXWx6rrXNrqueZZyasW7GxKmnnqSZo3q0u82gZLCZo2K9s7vBmpmlsV2WerOx0qmmp6uVYsGwecaepquflWK1or7RoqqopqNir63Bza1knKqZqbaktdKmZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

In the wake of her death, the Broadway legend earned touching tributes from a select circle of actresses: the Anitas that came after her. Rivera was the very first Anita in the 1957 stage production of&nbsp;West Side Story&nbsp;and after news of her death made headlines today, Rita Moreno, Ariana DeBose, and Debbie Allen shared touching messages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moreno famously played Anita in the 1961 film version of West Side Story. She shared a statement with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, saying, "Chita Rivera is eternal. I remember seeing her for the first time in&nbsp;Mr. Wonderful&nbsp;and exclaiming, 'Oh my God, who&nbsp;is&nbsp;that?' When I found out that this astonishing creature was one of my people, I crowed with pride."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Over the years, we were sometimes mistaken for each other, which I always viewed as a badge of honor," Moreno's message continued. "She was the essence of Broadway. As I write this, I am raising a glass to this remarkable woman and friend. Chita, amiga, Salud!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Debbie Allen played the part of Anita in the 1980 Broadway revival of West Side Story. It also earned her a Tony Award nomination. She shared a message on Instagram, calling Rivera her mentor, friend, and inspiration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My Mentor, My Friend, Our Goddess of Inspiration and Joy — Thank You," she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote</a>. "Every moment of your life has been a treasure of what is possible. I will miss touching you, but I will forever hear your laughter and hold that baton of power you tossed my way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ariana DeBose, who won an Oscar for her version of Anita in Steven Spielberg's 2021 film adaptation of West Side Story, also shared a touching message on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In truth, she made me nervous. To be in her presence was to behold greatness. I always got the sense that she had great expectations, but none greater than the ones she held herself to," she wrote. "I am heartbroken and yet ever inspired as she showed so many of us what was possible. Rest well, Queen."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Pictorial Parade/Archive Photos/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her career, Rivera earned 10 Tony nominations, winning two for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.

“I didn’t have to get nude, so that was good,” says adult-film star Spencer Scott of her Entourage audition.
Scott, 26, says she beat out “a bunch of girls” to land her nonspeaking part in the big-screen adaptation of the HBO comedy series: During a hotel-room showdown (at Montage Beverly Hills) between Jeremy Piven’s Ari Gold and Haley Joel Osment’s character — the spoiled son of a Texan movie financier (Billy Bob Thornton) — she and another porn star, Anna Morna, simulate oral sex on each other."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He kept trying to reposition me — he didn’t want them to be so in-your-face.” Despite <span data-scayt_word="Ellin's" data-scaytid=9>Ellin’s</span> best efforts, an early cut of the film was slapped with an NC-17 rating. Some strategic edits eventually earned it an R for “strong sexual content, nudity and some drug use.”</p><p>A former high school cheerleader, Scott moved to Los Angeles in 2007 from her hometown of Dallas, Georgia. In October of that year, she was Playboy‘s Playmate of the Month. She segued from nude modeling to porn about four years ago and has since starred in films like My Roommate’s a Lesbian 2 and Water Guns.</p><p>Scott, who calls herself a “big fan” of Entourage, has logged some experience with another HBO property, albeit in spoof form: She put her platinum blond locks to good use playing Daenerys Targaryen in 2014’s This Ain’t Game of Thrones XXX, a porn parody of the fantasy series.</p><p>Adult-film stars have long been a staple of Entourage, which aired on HBO from 2004 to 2011. For example, <strong>Jesse Jane</strong>, <strong>Devon</strong> and <strong>Teagan Presley</strong> were enlisted by the boys to seduce an influential fanboy blogger (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_rainn-wilson data-tag=rainn-wilson>Rainn Wilson</a></strong>) in an episode from the second season. Five seasons later, <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_sasha-grey data-tag=sasha-grey>Sasha Grey</a></strong> played herself in a six-episode arc that positioned her as love interest for Vincent Chase (<strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_adrian-grenier data-tag=adrian-grenier>Adrian Grenier</a></strong>).</p><p>Ask Ellin about Scott and Morna, however, and he pleads ignorance: “I did not know they were actual porn stars,” he says, adding that he was “very uncomfortable” directing that scene. “Had I known they were porn stars, I probably would have been more confident.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKa606isq5mXmnquu9WinGaon6e7br%2FTmqmsZZGnsm6DmG9wbHBf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

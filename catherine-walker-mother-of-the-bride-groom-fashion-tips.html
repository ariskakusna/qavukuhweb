With that in mind, we asked the label’s co-founder and head of design, Said Cyrus, to share his top tips to ensure mothers of the bride and groom look – and feel – their best this wedding season…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d7cdf0143ec-carole-middleton-pippa-middleton-wedding-2017-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eV09h0CWtT_s data-wc=13><strong>Carole Middleton wore Catherine Walker & Co to both of her daughters' weddings</strong></p><h3></h3><p id=eEcc7Cd2ccTk data-wc=62>The mother of the bride and groom will star in many of the main wedding photos alongside the bridesmaids and groomsmen, so it’s important to pick an outfit that complements the colour scheme chosen. It doesn’t have to be a perfect match, but wearing a colour that works well with the bridal party will help the group photos to look more cohesive.</p><p id=eqof1Or3ubpx data-wc=1><strong>GALLERY: <a class=hm-link href=#>Most stylish celebrity mother of the brides</a></strong></p><h3></h3><p id=eeEnxGRtLogL data-wc=50>It can be overwhelming when you’re faced with a huge array of colours, styles and prints while occasionwear shopping, making it challenging to find something that not only works with the wedding’s colour scheme, but also suits you. If in doubt, ask the experts, who will be happy to help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ee923ff6bca-catherine-walker-selena-z.jpg><h3></h3><p id=eJr1CGe9Kyjp data-wc=50>You may want everything to match, but even choosing accessories and footwear in contrasting tones can have a big impact on your overall ensemble. Look to Carole Middleton, who complemented her powder blue royal wedding outfit with a pale grey clutch bag and court shoes, rather than wearing head-to-toe blue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3a48462c4ba-carole-middleton-royal-wedding-z.jpg><h3></h3><p id=eP7ITR2shoQf data-wc=26>This is a speciality of Catherine Walker & Co, with Said noting that "mother of the brides are seen a lot from the back at weddings!"</p><p id=ejaU0apT4yc8 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The royals' guide to wedding guest dressing - tips from Kate, Meghan and more</a></strong></p><h3></h3><p id=ep9-oxb3HYDH data-wc=31>You won’t be wearing a coat or jacket all day, so pay attention to what’s underneath it to ensure you still feel your best long after the wedding ceremony is over.</p><h3></h3><p id=e2SIkW0mXOEE data-wc=27>Experiment with the fabric either as applique such as Catherine Walker’s Mount coat and dress, or one standalone piece such as the Hampton dress and Selena suit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e4518ef2e0ff-catherine-walker-mount-lace-z.jpg><h3></h3><p id=eYc-cLqRPGSa data-wc=74>It can be difficult to find a match between your outfit and accessories when buying from a variety of shops, so going to a specialist designer who can create pieces like hats and clutch bags to co-ordinate with your chosen ensemble could make the process much easier. Said says of Catherine Walker & Co’s service: "The hats are also designed to work in harmony rather than ‘fight’ with garments in making a fashion statement."</p><h3></h3><p id=e5nDANICRSlm data-wc=43>Said regularly takes orders six months or more in advance of a wedding date, and it’s a good idea to allow more time to look for your own perfect outfit, especially if you may need any alterations. It’s never too early to start!</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=etE8FYcK7wJp data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

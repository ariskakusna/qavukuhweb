He wasn’t a part of the show, but his image on WWE programming certainly gave them hope that he figured something out with WWE. It doesn’t seem like that is the case.</p><p><a href=#>Edge showed up in the opening video package for SmackDown</a>. That surprised a lot of fans, especially since it was thought that he is AEW bound.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a> was told by a tenured member of the WWE creative team that it is still the “internal speculation or prediction” that Edge is going to AEW. This speculation has not changed since Edge allowed his WWE contract to run up after his SmackDown match in Toronto against Sheamus.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News previously exclusively reported that </a>there is an internal belief within WWE that Edge is going to AEW. A short time later, <a href=#>Sean Sapp reported that there is also belief</a> within AEW that Tony Khan will ink Adam Copeland to a deal.</p><p><a href=#>Christian refused to comment</a> about Edge’s possible AEW future during the All Out press conference. Captain Charisma made it clear that he will only talk about himself or Luchasaurus.</p><p>Edge<a href=#> released statement via a video message</a> to clear up his side of the story. The WWE Hall of Famer said that there is a contract renewal in his inbox right now, but he doesn’t know what to do.</p><p>Keep in mind that, when <a href=#>WWE re-signed Edge in 2019</a>, he had his own version of events. In <a href=#>a January 2020 interview,</a> the Rated R Superstar addressed rumors that he was spotted in the city of WWE’s doctor by outright denying it.</p><p>“All of these rumors that I’ve been to Pittsburgh and I’ve been cleared to wrestle, and I’ve signed a new contract. I have no idea where any of it came from. The last time I was in Pittsburgh I had my wrist fused in 2013. I don’t know.”</p><p>Edge also <a href=#>tried to throw fans off by posing his location</a> before that historic 2020 Royal Rumble return. Needless to say, he has a lot of old-school tricks up his sleeves.</p><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more on this still-developing story. AEW could find a few places to put Edge, especially after they lost a big name like CM Punk.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Edge could be a big deal in AEW, but he’d have to go as Adam Copeland or figure something else out. After all, WWE has a lock on that Hall of Fame name. As always, please leave your comments in the space below to let us know what you’re thinking!</p><p>September 9, 2023 10:48 am</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e49yZmlxX6zEpnnIp6ueqp6WuW6%2Fz56arqSRqbawuoyamaitpGKypbPEZp6ooZ6cerW7jJqcsGWYlsCvwIycn5qml5qxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

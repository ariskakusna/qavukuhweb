Liv’s Telecafé, a coffee kiosk operating out of a disused, Grade-II listed red phone box, has started serving customers from its premises on Twickenham Green.
Restaurant worker Livia set up the café after being made redundant from her job at a nearby hotel during the national lockdown.
The Hungarian-born business owner said: “I’ve always wanted to run my own business and it’s great to see the takeaway business start to grow."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We expect sales to have a seasonal dimension with sales in the summer probably a lot higher than in the winter, so the coming few months is likely to be challenging.”</p><p>The coffee served at Liv’s Telecafé is ethically sourced and hand roasted by the independent roasting business Scotties Coffee, also in Twickenham.</p><p>Livia personally serves customers her range of items including teas, other hot drinks and snacks and so far, she has received positive feedback from satisfied customers on a local Facebook group.</p><p>One user commented: “I had my coffee too, very nice and friendly service.”</p><p>In the coming months, Livia plans to expand the menu by adding fresh juices, smoothies and sandwiches to the current range.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the entrepreneur is excited to eventually provide jobs to those most in need in the community by rolling out more kiosks across London and eventually owning her own on-premises café.</p><p>“I realise that it will take time to gradually build up and that I will need to be persistent and patient,” Livia concluded.</p><p>To follow updates about Liv’s Telecafé, visit the <a href=# rel=nofollow><u>Instagram</u></a> account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXLqKWdp55ju6bD0miuoZmkqHqwuo6fpqicXZm%2FqrrKZqWer6Nku6bDjK2cpZ2gnbyvsYybprFlk5azbq7EoKCnq11nfnqEkXFscQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The beloved zookeeper is worth $5 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. It's an impressive figure to have clawed up, but perhaps even more impressive is the star's impact <a href=#>on his zoo</a> and on the masses. According to that outlet, during Hanna's 42-year tenure at the Columbus Zoo, they, "made the transition from cage-like enclosures to habitat environments, and the annual attendance... increased by over 400%." According to <a href=#>Columbus Dispatch</a>, during his later years at the zoo, Hanna wasn't overseeing day-to-day operations but "always draws a crowd" when visiting.</p><p>Hanna has plenty of options for where to enjoy his retirement. The <a href=#>Emmy-winner</a> and his&nbsp;wife, Suzi Hanna, own&nbsp;a secluded cabin near&nbsp;Glacier National Park in Montana. The cabin arguably reflects Hanna's humility. According to <a href=#>Cabin Life</a>, it's "truly petite" at just 700 square feet.&nbsp;"When we were building it, we really didn't know what we were doing," he told the outlet. "But I figured, hey, it's a cabin – four walls, one room downstairs, a loft upstairs, put a kitchen in, and that's it."</p><p>According to <a href=#>Hanna's website</a>, he&nbsp;still calls "Central Ohio home" and also has&nbsp;a home in Rwanda, "that we [he and his wife] visit every year." According to the&nbsp;Columbus Zoo press release for his retirement, Hanna will now "spend more time" with his grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9mboJze8eormalpZi1brnOp5yyZZmoequtwqRkoZmeo65uw86rq6Fn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

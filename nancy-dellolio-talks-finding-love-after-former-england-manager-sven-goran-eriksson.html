In an exclusive interview and photoshoot with <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!</a> magazine, the glamorous Italian lawyer also tells how she attracts younger men as she gets older. "Sex and physical attraction are very important and it’s much better in my 50s than in my 20s. After 40, women are in complete control and you know exactly what you want and what you don’t," Nancy told HELLO! "When I was growing up I was looking for security and stability and I was sometimes attracted to older men. Now, I find myself in situations where younger men are attracted to me, maybe because I get younger and younger. I call myself the female Peter Pan.</p><p id=eXnBBzdKujJ data-wc=69>"I think this new generation of young men are much more mature compared with when I was in my 30s. They are more in touch with their emotions and they’re not scared of women, maybe because their mothers are different women and we are living in a different world," adds Nancy, who last year enjoyed a romance with Flavio Nappi, a handsome Italian more than 20 years her junior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e598393fc7f-nancy-dellolio-hello-magazine-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0R5qV-KFpJ data-wc=6><strong>Nancy Dell'Olio has never been happier!</strong></p><p id=e14JojKS0sh data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Nancy Dell'Olio looks unrecognisable at charity auction</a></p><p id=eLGpDwNGsxpr data-wc=54>Nancy also tells the magazine about her latest TV venture, a four-part series called which starts on 19 July on ITV, in which she and seven other women, including Melinda Messenger, Sian Lloyd and Ingrid Tarrant, bond and embark on a journey of self-discovery during a break together in Greece.</p><p id=ek9AqGNs5ulL data-wc=76>Nancy was thrust into the spotlight when she was dating former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson. Along with the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham</a>, Cheryl Tweedy and <a class=hm-link href=#>Coleen Rooney</a>, she brought a touch of sparkle to the 2006 tournament in Baden Baden, Germany, where the partners of the England team became known as WAGs.

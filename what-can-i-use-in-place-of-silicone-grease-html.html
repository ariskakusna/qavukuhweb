 Answer
It will take 6 months to a year for Vaseline and any other oil-based lubricant to break down the Nitrile Butadiene Rubber. Oils such as olive oil, WD40, or 3-in-1 oils are too thin and will not hold their shape for an extended period of time. There is no acceptable replacement for Silicone Grease on the market today.
 
Simply put, what can be used in lieu of silicone grease is a question."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It is a silicone-based grease that is waterproof and manufactured by mixing silicone oil, generally polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), with a thickening, which is commonly silicone grease, to form a paste.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p></p><h3>Aside from that, is Vaseline the same as silicone grease in terms of consistency?</h3><p>They should both function properly at normal temperature. Vaseline, on the other hand, is a low molecular weight paraffin that has an extremely low melting point. Designed for use in high-temperature situations, silicone grease is very durable.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>When it comes to O rings, what is the most effective lubricant?</h3><p>When it comes to rubber o-rings and seals, silicone lubricant grease is the finest choice. The majority of O-rings are constructed of synthetic rubber. There are three types of rubber: nitrile, EPDM, and Neoprene. It is true that petroleum compounds will cause natural rubber to deteriorate over time.</p><p></p><h3>There were 38 related questions and answers found.</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><h3>Is it okay to put Vaseline on O rings?</h3><p>You shouldn’t put Vaseline on the rubber gaskets on your pool equipment, Mike, since it will cause them to fail. The petroleum-based jelly eats away at the rubber, causing the rubber to stretch or tear more quickly than it would have otherwise done. In order to maintain the rubber smooth and supple, a Teflon or Silicone-based lubricant is advised for pool o-rings.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is silicone spray the same as silicone grease in terms of properties?</h3><p>The same may be said about silicone grease lubricant. The light hydrocarbon propellants used in the spray lubes are the majority (and a few proprietary odds and ends for voodoo purposes). There are a plethora of different grease compositions available.</p><p></p><h3>Is silicone grease prone to drying out?</h3><p>It is not necessary to use oily silicone grease since it will not degrade, dry up, or run out of the threading region (if the silicone grease is of the sticky, greasy form rather than the oily version).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is plumbers’ silicone grease a health hazard?</h3><p>Silicone is available in a variety of forms, and a high-quality plumber’s silicon grease is completely non-toxic.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Is it true that WD40 damages rubber seals?</h3><p>In accordance with the website, WD40 is non-corrosive to rubber. Polycarbonate and clear polystyrene are the only two materials that have been identified as potentially affected. However, since it is a petoleum-based product, I would agree with Alex Rogers that it should not be exposed to natural rubber in any way.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>When should I use silicone lubricant and when shouldn’t I?</h3><p>Silicone may be used to lubricate metal, wood, rubber, and plastic surfaces. Silicone, on the other hand, attracts dust and dirt, so use it sparingly or opt for a “dry” version in dusty or dirty environments. The most significant disadvantage of silicone spray lubricant is that once it has been applied to an item, it cannot be painted or stained.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to put lithium grease on O rings?</h3><p>O-rings and Lithium Grease in Relation to It’s a silicone grease that also contains teflon. The grease is slippery and non-adhesive to o-rings and teflon materials, which are used in areas where metal to metal contact occurs (the threads of our lights).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h3>Is it true that Vaseline damages rubber seals?</h3><p>When working with rubber or neoprene materials, never use Vaseline or any other petroleum-based products. It has the potential to degrade rubber or neoprene in a short period of time. When it comes to lubricants, silicone-based lubricants with or without Teflon are the most appropriate choice.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to use Vaseline as grease?</h3><p>Also advised against are lubricants containing oil, fat, or grease (such as Vaseline) since they might cause harm to latex condoms, according to the Food and Drug Administration.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it necessary to lubricate O rings?</h3><p>Lubricants are often used on O-rings and other elastomeric seals in a variety of applications. Use of an abrasion-resistant grease or oil during assembly helps to prevent the O-ring from being damaged by abrasions, pinching, or cutting. It aids in the protection of various polymers against degradation caused by the environment, and its presence aids in the extension of the service life of the O-ring.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>Is it true that Vaseline has an effect on silicone?</h3><p>When used with silicone, any water-based lubricant will be completely safe to use. Specifically, only petroleum jelly-based lubes and silicone-based lubes are known to create problems with silicone. As a matter of fact, not all silicone-based lubrication will cause harm to silicone-based devices, despite the sweeping statements made by so many sex toy talking heads.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is silicone grease derived from petroleum?</h3><p>Silicone grease is NOT a petroleum product; rather, it is a thicker silicone oil that is used to lubricate rubbers and synthetic rubbers rather than pack them. This substance is not used for ‘packing,’ since the materials it is meant to lubricate are the proper packaging in and of themselves.</p><p></p><h3>Is Vaseline composed of silicone?</h3><p>Vaseline, often known as petroleum jelly, is an ointment that is based on oil. It’s soft, sticky, and silky to the touch. Vaseline seems to have the potential to be an excellent lubrication for sex. The reality is that there are a plethora of superior alternatives.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>6</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxyfo6wn5qsXZiur3nIZqysnV2eu268y5qanmWfm3q0tcuimqimlWK0s7HArJxnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

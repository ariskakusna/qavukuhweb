In the following weeks fans could see Zayn being enraged at the Tribal Chief, which clearly tells the fans that he is indeed hurt and feels betrayed.</p><p>While the WWE Universe seems to be on Zayn’s side, his biggest supporters are his family. Zayn’s wife Khadija recently spoke to WWE about what the match at the Elimination Chamber means to her husband.</p><p>“I just get goosebumps thinking about what tomorrow night’s gonna be like. It’s gonna be so emotional and just thinking about it… he deserves the world, he deserves this moment, he deserves all the love from everyone in Montreal and the whole WWE Universe. He’s worked so hard and I really believe that it’s just gonna be a really memorable moment that we’re never gonna forget for the rest of our lives.”</p><p>This week on Friday Night SmackDown, Sami Zayn received a warm welcome from the Montreal crowd, which included “OLE” chants as a tribute to his El Generico Character.

He then asserted that it would be Roman Reigns vs. Sami Zayn and the entire city of Montreal at the Elimination Chamber. <a href=#>FOX also had to bleep the crowd’s “F*ck you Roman” chants.</a></p><p>We will have to see how everything pans out at Elimination Chamber, but we will have complete coverage right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story with Sami Zayn on the road to WrestleMania?

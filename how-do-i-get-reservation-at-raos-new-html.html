Truth (No Chaser)</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:385><span>Let's get this out of the way first:</span><span> </span><strong>Rao's doesn't take reservations the way us normal folk are used to</strong><span>.</span><span> Their coveted tables are practically heirlooms,</span><span> passed down through generations of lucky patrons.</span><span> Imagine showing up for your dinner date,</span><span> smugly brandishing a reservation confirmation email,</span><span> only to be met with a confused stare and a gentle,</span><span> "Honey,</span><span> this ain't Olive Garden.</span><span>"</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=9:1-9:54>Operation: Dinner Date Impossible (But Maybe Not?)</h3><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:132><span>So,</span><span> how does a mere mortal like

into Jay-Z's inner circle,</span><span> or channel your inner Scorsese and become a film director with a penchant for gangsters (allegedly their clientele back in the day).</span><span> Easy

eggplant parm.</span></p></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:151><strong>Remember:</strong><span> There's no guaranteed formula,</span><span> but a dash of charm,</span><span> a sprinkle of

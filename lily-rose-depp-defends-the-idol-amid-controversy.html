That’s something I knew I was setting out to do from the beginning. I was never interested in making something puritanical. It’s OK if this show isn’t for everyone and that’s fine — I think all the best art is [polarizing]." &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/03423f817bbd-0229theidols01.jpg><p id=e5c3Qgk9nux data-wc=110>Her co-star Troye Sivan added: <a class=hm-link href=#>"I've never felt more respected</a> and more safe on a set, honestly. And I think the trust that we all built with each other, you and I [Sivan plays Xander], and [creator <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sam Levinson</a>] and I, and Abel and I, that can only make for a really safe-feeling set. So when it comes to the nudity and the risqué nature of the role, that to me was really intentional. That was really important to me and something that I was excited about doing. I’m not scared of it. I think we live in a highly sexualized world. I think that’s an interesting thing to explore."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dcc9eaa4a0c5-0324theidols01.jpg><p id=eeYHMLnPBdS data-wc=47>The finale of the series is titled Jocelyn Forever, and will serve as the season finale. Although it was originally announced as a six episode series, a source told TVLine only five episodes were required after showrunner Sam was brought in to make changes to the plot.</p><p id=emg8D5tHG8 data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Lily-Rose Depp soft launches new relationship as she styles out ripped jeans</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dcd9ed254fb7-0217theidols01.jpg><p id=eovdiaCrQvq data-wc=56>Despite rumors that the show has already been cancelled ahead of announcing season two, HBO released a statement about the situation, which read: "It is being misreported that a decision on a second season of The Idol has been determined. It has not, and we look forward to sharing the next episode with you Sunday night."&nbsp;</p><p id=ee5RgEsd3lB data-wc=100>Viewers have had plenty to say about the show, with one writing: "He’s not even making it to the originally planned six episodes, let alone the Emmy’s at this point. Perfect example of an overinflated ego believing they can be successful in an arena they have no business being it," while another person added: "The Idol could have been so much more. Lily-Rose Depp is talented. The writing and The Weekend is not so much also the fact the Abel’s mini emoji is forced upon my hashtag confirms this was about him playing out some weird fantasy. Not the story."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG9uYWh8rbXLsmSrp6OaeqWxz6lknZ2Wmrulv4ytn55lmZm8rXnApqCdZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6upZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

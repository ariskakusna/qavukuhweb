The former pair briefly dated after the altar, but things fizzled out soon after as Micah travels to Arizona often. Paul, however, did visit her during one weekend.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=tiffany-and-brett>Tiffany and Brett</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/04/LIB_S4_Reunion_0127_R-683x1024.jpg><p>We’re delighted to announce that Tiffany and Brett are still married. The season 4 favorites were a strong couple since their pod days, despite Tiffany falling asleep mid-conversation.</p><p>The Browns sailed through the episodes without any major issues, making them the only couple where an “I do” was guaranteed.</p><p>But there was a downside to their happily ever after; the pair barely received any screentime during the reunion despite being fan favorites, but that’s probably down to their lack of juicy drama – their romance was just too smooth for reality TV.</p><p>“The lack of Brett and Tiffany in the reunion was more frustrating than the live event not working,” one fan complained. “Wtf Netflix? Their love story is magic and y’all cared more about cold tea.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=bliss-and-zack>Bliss and Zack</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/04/LIB_S4_Reunion_0286_R-683x1024.jpg><p>Zack and Bliss managed to overcome his major pod mistake, so of course they’ve made it to their one-year anniversary. The couple sat hand-in-hand at the reunion in their matching purple fits; Bliss wore a satin corset gown, while Zack complimented her with a matching tie.</p><p>The lawyer spilt major tea during the event as he reflected on his relationship with Irina, and even accused of her joining the show to become famous.</p><p>As for Zack’s relationship with Bliss’ family, he didn’t receive the best reception from his father-in-law during their first meeting, but Bliss has confirmed they are now best buds and chat non-stop during family gatherings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=chelsea-and-kwame>Chelsea and Kwame</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/04/LIB_S4_Reunion_0482_R-683x1024.jpg><p>The couple hit several bumps during their Love Is Blind journey – from their almost love triangle with Micah, to Kwame’s worries about marrying outside of his Ghanaian culture, their romance was anything but smooth.</p><p>One year later, the pair are still married and currently reside in a stunning Seattle apartment with a water view. Fans saw a glimpse of the modern property at the reunion and we’re surprised at the size. Didn’t Kwame complain about Seattle’s prices, calling it “Lamar Odom with Michael Jordan prices?”</p><p>We’re happy to reveal that Chelsea finally met her mother-in-law, who welcomed her with open arms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K1ssuir2aqlZa5qsDYZqqhp6eofLi0zmagrGWjqbatuIytpqCdpJ2ys3nFq6amZZykw6Z5yKxkm6SZo7Fuv8SaqqimXWk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

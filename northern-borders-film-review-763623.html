Set in Kingdom County, Vermont, and made with the collaboration of dozens of students from the region’s Marlboro College—they earned course credits for their efforts—Northern Borders is a leisurely paced coming-of-age tale made notable by the starring turns of screen veterans <strong>Bruce Dern</strong> and <strong>Genevieve Bujold</strong>. Although the film could find appreciative audiences in New England, theatrical prospects look otherwise iffy, although the thesps’ name recognition factor should help it garner exposure in ancillary markets.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>The central character is twelve-year-old Austen Kittredge III (<strong>Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick</strong>), who in 1956 is sent by his single, unemployed father to live with his grandparents on their Vermont farm. It’s not an easy transition. The couple, whose marriage is described as the “Forty Years War,” barely speaks to each other, preferring, in one of the film’s more tired running gags, to communicate through their new boarder.</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">Bruce Dern and Genevieve Bujold enliven this leisurely paced coming-of-age tale</span></p><p><strong>Read More</strong> <a href=#>AFI Fest: Bruce Dern Charms Crowd With Tales of Hollywood Legends at ‘Nebraska’ Screening</a></p><p>They’re an eccentric pair, with the senior Austen (Dern) being the sort of crotchety old coot who proudly declares “I never exchanged presents with anyone in my life” and Abiah (Bujold) strangely obsessed with all things Egyptian, constantly calling her grandson “Tut” because of his supposed resemblance to the young pharaoh.</p><p>Despite the clear contempt for his adult children that he displays during an ill-advised family reunion dinner, the senior Austen eventually warms to his grandson, at one point telling him about a lost love decades earlier that helps explain his prickliness. Further family secrets are eventually revealed in schematic fashion, including, most improbably, the reappearance of daughter Liz (<strong>Jessica Hecht</strong>, delivering an engagingly exuberant performance), an accused bank robber on the lam who may have buried her ill-gotten gains on the family farm.</p><p>The low-key storyline meanders along in episodic fashion, with one of the more notable if less than compelling plot elements being the elderly couple’s court battle over his decision to allow their property to be wired for electricity, which she claims will damage her apple trees.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong> <a href=#>Bruce Dern Alfonso Cuaron Honored at AARP’s Movies for Grownups Awards</a></p><p>It all adds up to somewhat less than the sum of its parts, but it’s made palatable by the well-evoked rural atmosphere and the typically expert performances by the two leads. Dern, settling into the old codger phase (Nebraska) of his distinguished career with an easy grace, wisely doesn’t overplay his character’s orneriness, while Bujold’s ethereal charm serves her well as the enigmatic Abiah. Davey-Fitzpatrick, although saddled with an unfortunate bowl haircut, is appealingly natural as the young protagonist, and there are brief but effective turns by such veteran character actors as <strong>Jay O. Sanders</strong>, <strong>John Rothman</strong>, <strong>John Shea</strong> and <strong>Mark Margolis</strong>, among others.</p><p>Production: Kingdom Country Productions<br>Cast: Bruce Dern, Genevieve Bujold, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, Jessica Hecht, Jacqueline Hennessey, Alicia Lyn Hunt, Kaley Ronayne<br>Director/screenwriter/editor: Jay Craven<br>Producers: Jay Craven, Chip Hourihan<br>Executive producer: Ellen McCulloch-Lovell<br>Director of photography: Brad Heck<br>Production designer: Dara Wishingrad<br>Costume designer: Jessie Shul<br>Composers: Judy Hyman, Jeff Claus</p><p>No rating, 108 min.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2Fjqemq6yYmr%2BvecGoqZ2doqh6p7XLpmSrnaaesrh5lm9qb2pjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

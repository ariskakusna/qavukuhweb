The test is based on the company’s core values, which all employees are expected to embrace and reflect on. It is necessary to pass this test before being granted an interview and being considered for a job.</p><p>The interview needs to be done online, and it is best to complete it at home. If you do not pass the assessment, you will not usually be asked to attend an interview. However, it is possible to take the test again in six months if you still want to work at Walmart.</p><h2><span id=Areas_Covered_In_The_Test>Areas Covered In The Test</span></h2><p>The main assessment is intended for entry-level roles in one of the company’s stores. This includes team members, cashiers, and shelf stockers. The test is divided into four sections, and it is important to do well in each of the sections.</p><h3><span id=Customer_Service>Customer Service</span></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/How-Long-Is-Orientation-At-Walmart.png alt="How Long Is Orientation At Walmart?" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>All people who work in one of the company’s stores are expected to have strong customer service skills.

This area of the test is designed to make sure you have good customer service skills.</p><p>This part of the test will present you with several different scenarios. You will be asked to choose the best course of action for the particular situation that is outlined. Pay attention to the keywords that are used in the description of the situation. Try to relate the described situation to a situation you have been faced with in the past and handled well.</p><h3><span id=Problem_Solving>Problem Solving</span></h3><p>Many of the jobs in stores require a certain amount of cash handling. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate that you have at least a basic understanding of math. The tests in this section will instruct you to correctly use charts and graphs and show other basic math skills.</p><h3><span id=Work_Experience>Work Experience</span></h3><p>This part follows a similar format to the section on your resume. The trick to scoring highly is to match your specialist skills with the skills highlighted in the job description. But, if you don’t have any work experience yet, it is best, to be honest and state this. Many entry-level roles do not require work experience if you meet the other requirements.</p><h3><span id=Personality_Questionnaire>Personality Questionnaire</span></h3><p>Many applicants find this to be one of the most difficult sections of the test. The basic goal is showing that you have the right personality traits for the role you are applying for. Carefully read the job description and work out which personality traits are likely to be valuable.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=How_To_Pass_The_Walmart_Assessmentnbsp>How To Pass The Walmart Assessment&nbsp;</span></h2><p>If you have never taken a test of this type before, the company’s assessment may seem overwhelming.

You can also find a few practice tests online that will help you to hone your assessment-taking skills.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=Get_advice_from_current_and_former_employeesnbsp>Get advice from current and former employees&nbsp;</span></h3><p>Everyone who&nbsp;<strong>works for Walmart</strong>&nbsp;will have taken the assessment at one point.

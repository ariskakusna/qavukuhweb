Many Nigerian acts are beginning to be recognized as bonafide superstars. Case in point is the recent Grammy wins of <a href=#>Wizkid and Burna Boy</a>.</p><p class=align-left>However, little is known of the inspiration behind the careers of these musicians. This particular answer is left unanswered and it has become a source of worry for fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f3b82d385a2c1f10.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 Nigerian celebrities who have been hosted in Wizkid's Ghana residence</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Perhaps it is with this in mind that fast-rising Nigerian singer Acebergtm has revealed the international musicians who influence his sound. Speaking recently with Legit.ng, he explained that American/Haitian musician Wyclef is a major inspiration as well as rappers J.Cole and Drake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f3b82d385a2c1f10.jpg><p class=align-left>Acebergtm then goes on to create an impressive fusion of these influences on his first single of the year titled Danca. Signed to fast-growing <a href=#>entertainment</a> company SJW Entertainment, Danca is the first single from his forthcoming Far From Home EP.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking on his thought process that led to the creation of the Far From Home project, he said:</p>"As a kid growing up in a city populated with creatives, Far From Home was inspired by the thought of me trying to be abstract. As a rapper trying to show more versatility and fitting into my own niche in the music industry. The EP represents a journey, untold stories, and the passion for being extraordinary." <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1eb21e2547c8c7ec.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Love you for life: Davido celebrates Mayorkun with touching words on 27th birthday</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With his roots in <a href=#>Lagos</a>, Nigeria, Acebergtm who already had a passion for writing and poetry began writing his own songs at age 15.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Legit.ng News on your Facebook News Feed!</a></p><p class=align-left>He eventually entered the studio circuit, networking with different producers and other fledgling artists such as Kel P, Phantom and Tempoe, WineXroll, JFred, Fredibeat, Oshobeats, Mcomms and Graydon.

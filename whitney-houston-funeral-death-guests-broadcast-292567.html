Jesse Jackson</strong> on hand, though the service isn’t scheduled until 12 p.m. She was driven in a gold-colored hearse, complete with a black and white glamor shot of the singer propped up in the rear passenger side window. Droves of fans stood by as the singer’s body was carried into the church.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Hollywood Reporter </a>previously reported, <strong>Stevie Wonder, R. Kelly</strong> and <strong>Alicia Keys</strong> are expected to perform during the service, though <strong>Aretha Franklin</strong>, also slated to sing, was forced to back out in the 11th hour. She has been replaced by <strong>Queen Latifah.</strong></p><p>Spotted entering the church were r&b singer <strong>Ray J</strong>; New Jersey Governor <strong>Chris Christie</strong>;&nbsp; <strong>Star Jones</strong>; <strong>Forest Whitaker; Diane Sawyer; Mary J.

Her mentor, <strong>Clive Davis</strong>, will be a speaker.</p><p>Houston died Saturday at the Beverly Hilton hotel, at the age of 48. Her body was found “underwater and apparently unconscious” in a bathtub in her hotel room, police said. An autopsy was completed — but the results are on security hold pending a toxicology report.</p><p>Her body was flown into Newark on Monday night in Perry’s private jet; the casket was then driven to the Newark’s Whigham Funeral Home, which is handling the services. They can be viewed live on several cable networks and heard on Sirius XM radio’s Heart & Soul.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BstarAzZ6wZqCfqsC1u81mna6mlaeurXnDnpitoF2cwqa%2F06xkm6qflrGkrdKtZGtxYmqDeHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

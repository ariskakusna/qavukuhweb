But the man behind the Christian organization has long been at odds with Hollywood, pop culture and liberal America.</p><p><strong>Christopher Hudson</strong>, who calls himself the Forerunner, is a Seventh-day Adventist who is famous for the fiery sermons he gives in YouTube videos. In 2009, he gained notice for publishing online a <a href=# rel=nofollow>documentary called The Jay-Z Deception</a>, in which he accused the rap star of being a Freemason who released his Blueprint albums to celebrate his journey up the ranks of the organization and his links with Satan. He also says <strong>Kanye West </strong>and <strong>Rihanna </strong>are part of the conspiracy.</p><p><a href=#><strong>STORY: Angus T. Jones Will Not Appear in Next Two ‘Two and a Half Men’ Episodes</strong></a></p><p>As Hudson alleged in an interview in 2009, Satan is “using mediums like the music and the fashion industry, which are enticing to us on a very base level, dealing with our senses to draw us out of a reasonable, rational relationship with God.”</p><p>In The Jay-Z Deception, he says: “The Blueprint albums are markers in obtaining degrees in the secret organization known as the Freemasons.” The 2001 first album, he alleged, marked <strong>Jay-Z</strong>‘s acceptance into the organization, while the second album a year later marked his step up in the group. He said the third album — released seven years after The Blueprint 2 — marked the rapper’s obtaining of the Third Degree in the organization, which meant that he could lead lodge meetings.</p><p>Hudson was very much opposed to <strong>President Obama</strong>‘s re-election, and afterward posted a video urging supporters to open their eyes to the coming menaces of gay marriage, marijuana legalization and the damage done by Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>In 2011, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>claimed</a> that reports of the death of <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were part of a conspiracy and that the terrorist mastermind had been dead since 2007. In 2009, Hudson <a href=# rel=nofollow>released a video</a> in which he called masturbation an “unnatural act.” In the video, called “Voice of a Prophesy,” Jones said that he is still a virgin.</p><p>The actor described turning to religion during his parents’ divorce, after experimenting with drugs.</p><p>“When I look back now, I see that … the enemy was trying to push me in a different direction,” Jones said. “But God … pulled me out right at the last second.”</p><p>Hudson has also claimed that the death of <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> was a conspiracy, <a href=# rel=nofollow>calling it a cover-up</a> for the pope’s proposing a “new world order.” He said the pop star’s July 7, 2009, <a href=#>memorial service</a> was a distraction for <strong><span class=st>Pope Benedict XVI</span></strong>‘s call — in a document issued that same day — for a global political body to help pull the world out of the economic crisis.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKe70Z6prqaemr9ur8erpqehk6GytHnCoamiq12dwqW%2FzqdkmqaXqsBuf5htbGpqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

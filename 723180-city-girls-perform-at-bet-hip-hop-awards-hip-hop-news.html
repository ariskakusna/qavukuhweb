First <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">JT stepped up to play her debut solo single</a> "No Bars." The track dropped earlier this year and was followed by an announcement in an interview that she was planning on making an entire solo album eventually. After that, the duo played <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">their newest single "Face Down."</a> The sexually charged banger dropped back in artists and has racked up nearly 3 million Spotify streams since. Check out the full video of the hard-hitting performance below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-city-girls-take-the-bet-hip-hop-awards-stage>City Girls Take The BET Hip Hop Awards Stage</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier today, City Girls made an announcement that had their fans buzzing. They've been teasing a new album for a while but now it's got an official name. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The project is called R.A.W</a>, which fittingly stands for "Real A*s Wh*res." They didn't give an official release date for the project but fans won't have to wait too long as they promised that it was coming this month. They've released 4 new singles this year in the lead up to the project, most notable "Act Bad" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fabolous</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite being busy recording their new album the City Girls are still getting up to some fun. The pair attended a show on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>'s Renaissance tour last month. While there they shared clips of themselves seemingly having the time of their lives during the concert. Despite some fans online taking issue with their outfit choices, most loved the videos.

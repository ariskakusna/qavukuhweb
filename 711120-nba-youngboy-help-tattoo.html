The large piece, running from his clavicle to his pecs, is simply the word "HELP" written in bold block capitals. Fans are unsure of the tattoo's meaning and now are worried that the rapper may be in distress. YoungBoy has been under house arrest for several years now. However, the restrictions of that arrest were loosened earlier this year. The rapper is now allowed to have a few more visitors to his home and can do so without a curfew.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, this isn't the first time that fans have been worried about YoungBoy. Almost everything that the rapper posts or releases is interpreted as some sort of covert cry for help. Granted, this one is a literal cry for help. Regardless, this reaction isn't exactly new from his fanbase. However, YoungBoy nor anyone close to him has released a statement explaining the tattoo or highlighting that the rapper is under any kind of duress at the moment.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nba-youngboy-has-a-fan-in-blueface-s-son>NBA YoungBoy Has A Fan In Blueface's Son</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While he was not directly involved, YoungBoy did get something of a hilarious co-sign earlier this week. While making content, Blueface learned that his son doesn't know any of his music. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"You don't know one song?"</a> he asked him, to which the boy responded, "no." A shocked Blueface then grabbed his son as he tried to come to terms with the revelation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So when you sleeping you sing NBA YoungBoy's song, but you don't know your daddy's song," he asks Javaughn. "No," the boy replied, again. It's a wild and hilarious shoutout for YoungBoy, even though it's something of a crushing blow to Blueface. Not that the controversial Chicago rapper deserves much sympathy given how he treats Jayden Alexis and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chrisean Rock</a> but we digress. Elsewhere, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Birdman</a> recently begged YoungBoy to save hip hop. "You gotta save Hip Hop, bruh. Nephew, gotta save this shit bruh. Real talk," Birdman told the 23-year-old during a FaceTime.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.

I recall being at an event in Abuja some years ago and we were just catching up and he says to me "bros you nor remember say na you start me on this my journey?" And I was like ‘no way’ and he went on to narrate and he had come to me in the 90s for help and get into the movie industry and I had said I wasn’t doing any film then but I could send him to a friend and brother who did more productions than anyone else at the time and that brother and friend was Zeb EJIRO. I wrote behind my card and off he went and became a big star. The interesting thing then was that Zeb loved him so much he told me I had given him a natural replacement for me in the movies…" his post read in parts.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e61783bd80265fdb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Just in: Murphy Afolabi reportedly passes away after bathroom fall</span></p></a><p class=align-left>See <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his post</a> below:</p><h2>Internet users react to RMD’s tribute to Saint Obi</h2><p class=align-left>inidimaokojie:</p>"So many childhood memories May his soul rest in peace."<p class=align-left>adropofhoney_:</p>"I loved him from the movie- State of Emergency….Rest in peace Saint Obi."<p class=align-left>alexokoroji:</p>"Such a big loss.

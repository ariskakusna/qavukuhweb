The series is based on the essay “Things Left Behind” by Kim Sae-byul, a former trauma cleaner who shared his experiences of cleaning up the belongings of the deceased and delivering their final messages to their loved ones. The show follows Geu-ru, a young man with Asperger’s syndrome, who inherits his father’s trauma cleaning business and works with his uncle Sang-gu, a former boxer and ex-convict. Together, they encounter various stories of life and death as they move the hearts of the people they meet.</p><p>The first season of Move To Heaven received critical acclaim and positive reviews from viewers around the world. The show was praised for its heartwarming and emotional storytelling, its realistic and sensitive portrayal of trauma cleaning, its diverse and complex characters, and its stellar performances by the cast. The show also touched on various social issues such as domestic violence, suicide, organ donation, LGBTQ+ rights, and disability awareness.</p><p>Many fans of the show are eagerly waiting for the second season of Move To Heaven, hoping to see more of Geu-ru and Sang-gu’s journey and the stories of the people they help. However, as of November 06, 2023, there has been no official announcement from Netflix or the showrunners about the renewal or cancellation of the show. So, what are the chances of Move To Heaven season 2 happening? Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Move_To_Heaven_Season_2_Renewal_Status></span>Move To Heaven Season 2 Renewal Status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Netflix usually takes a few months to decide the fate of its original shows, depending on their viewership, ratings, and popularity. However, in the case of Korean dramas, the situation is more complicated. Most Korean dramas are designed to have only one season, with a limited number of episodes and a conclusive ending. There are only a few exceptions where Korean dramas get renewed for more seasons, such as Kingdom, Love Alarm, and Hospital Playlist. Therefore, the chances of Move To Heaven season 2 happening are not very high unless the showrunners have a compelling reason to continue the story.</p><p>Another factor that may affect the renewal of Move To Heaven season 2 is the availability of the cast and crew. The show features some of the most talented and busy actors in the Korean entertainment industry, such as Lee Je-hoon, Tang Joon-sang, Hong Seung-hee, Ji Jin-hee, and Yoon Ji-hye. They may have other projects and commitments that may prevent them from returning for another season. Moreover, the show’s director, Kim Sung-ho, and writer, Yoon Ji-Hyeon, may also have other plans and ideas that they want to pursue.</p><p>However, there is still some hope for the fans of Move To Heaven, as the show has not been officially canceled either. The show has been well-received by both domestic and international audiences and has been nominated for several awards, such as the Baeksang Arts Awards, the Seoul International Drama Awards, and the Asian Academy Creative Awards. The show has also been praised by the media and critics and has been featured on various lists of the best Korean dramas of 2021. The show has also generated a lot of buzz and discussion on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. Therefore, Netflix may consider the potential and popularity of the show and give it another chance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Move_To_Heaven_Season_2_Release_Date></span>Move To Heaven Season 2 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If Netflix decides to renew Move To Heaven for a second season, the next question is when will it be released? The production of Korean dramas usually takes several months, depending on the scale, budget, and quality of the show. The first season of Move To Heaven was filmed from August 2020 to January 2021 and was released in May 2021. Therefore, if the show gets greenlit for a second season soon, we can expect it <strong>to be released sometime in late 2024 or early 2025</strong>. However, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual release date may vary depending on various factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the schedule of the cast and crew, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the availability of Netflix</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Move-To-Heaven-Season-2-Cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Actor</th><th>Role</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=13><tr readability=4><td>Tang Joon-sang</td><td>Geu-ru</td><td>A young trauma cleaner with Asperger’s syndrome, who inherits his father’s business and works with his uncle</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Lee Je-hoon</td><td>Sang-gu</td><td>Geu-Ru’s friend and neighbor, who is a high school student and an aspiring journalist</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Hong Seung-hee</td><td>Na-mu</td><td>The main antagonist of the first season, who is a corrupt politician and the leader of an illegal gambling ring, escaped from the police in the finale</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Ji Jin-hee</td><td>Jeong-u</td><td>Geu-Ru’s father and the founder of Move To Heaven, died of a heart attack in the first episode</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Yoon Ji-hye</td><td>Joo Young</td><td>Geu-Ru’s childhood friend and Na-mu’s brother, who died of leukemia</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Shin Soo-oh</td><td>Kim Yong-woo</td><td>A young man who was involved in the gambling ring and became Sang-gu’s friend</td></tr><tr><td>Lee Jae-wook</td><td>Soo-cheol</td><td>Lee Jae-Wook</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Lee Re</td><td>Yoo-ri</td><td>A girl who was abused by her stepfather and committed suicide</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Geu-Ru’s father and the founder of Move To Heaven died of a heart attack in the first episode</td><td>Mr. Park</td><td>The owner of the funeral home and Sang-gu’s friend</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Move_To_Heaven_Season_2_Spoiler></span>Move To Heaven Season 2 Spoiler<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The spoiler of Move To Heaven season 2 will largely depend on the renewal status and the direction of the story. However, if the show continues to follow the lives of Geu-ru and Sang-gu, we can expect the second season to explore more of their relationship and their growth as individuals and as a family. The first season of Move To Heaven ended with Geu-ru and Sang-gu reconciling after a brief separation, and deciding to stay together as uncle and nephew. The second season may show how they cope with the challenges and changes in their lives, such as Geu-ru’s adulthood, Sang-gu’s boxing career, and their trauma-cleaning business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Move-To-Heaven-Season-2-Spoiler.jpg><p>The second season of Move To Heaven may also delve deeper into the stories of the people they help, and the messages they deliver. The show may explore various themes and topics, such as love, loss, forgiveness, redemption, hope, and healing. The show may also touch on various social issues, such as mental health, poverty, discrimination, and justice. The show may also reveal more of the past and secrets of the main characters, such as Geu-ru’s mother, Sang-gu’s parents, and Joo Young’s motives.</p><p>The second season of Move To Heaven may also feature more of the romance and friendship between Geu-ru and Na-mu. The first season hinted at Na-mu’s feelings for Geu-ru, but Geu-ru seemed oblivious to them. The second season may show how Geu-ru responds to Na-mu’s affection, and how they develop their relationship. The show may also show how Na-mu pursues her dream of becoming a journalist, and how she supports Geu-ru and Sang-gu.</p><p>The second season of Move To Heaven may also bring back Joo Young as the main villain, who may seek revenge on Geu-ru and Sang-gu for ruining his gambling ring and exposing his crimes. The show may also introduce some new enemies or obstacles, who may threaten or harm the trauma cleaners or the people they help. The show may also have some twists and surprises, that may shock or move the viewers.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Doona Kdrama Season 2 Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trailer></span>Trailer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no trailer for Move To Heaven season 2 yet, as the show has not been renewed or filmed. However, if the show gets greenlit for a second season soon, we can expect the trailer to be released a few weeks or months before the premiere date. The trailer may give us a glimpse of the plot, the cast, and the tone of the second season. The trailer may also tease some of the stories, messages, and emotions that the show will deliver.

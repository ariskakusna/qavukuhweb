His latest album, Almost Healed, has made an incredibly strong debut at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. According to Billboard, the album entered the chart at No. 3 in its first week, accumulating 125,000 album-equivalent units. Out of this total, 122,000 units were generated from 167.82 million on-demand official streams. The other 3,000 units came from track equivalent albums and pure album sales. This achievement marks the highest-selling week for Lil Durk as a solo artist. It surpassed the already impressive performance of his previous album, 7220, which opened with 120,500 units in March of last year.</p><p>However, this still does not surpass Lil Durk's most successful project. The rapper's most successful commercial project to date remains his joint album with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Baby</a>, The Voice of the Heroes. That album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with an impressive 150,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. Still, the new album is an impressive showing from the rapper. In addition to his spot on the Billboard 200, Lil Durk is anticipated to make a significant impact on the Billboard Hot 100 chart this week. All 21 tracks from Almost Healed are projected to land on the chart, according to Talk of the Charts. The song "Stand By Me," featuring Morgan Wallen, is expected to have the highest debut. Currently, Durk's collaboration with <a href=# class=text-word rel>J. Cole</a> on "All My Life" holds a spot in the top 10.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-durk-gives-back>Lil Durk Gives Back</h2></span><p>Lil Durk has made no secret of his d<a href=# rel>esire to do good recently</a>. Whether it's for his fans or the community, he wants to give back. In a heartwarming gesture towards his devoted fan base, Durk demonstrated his generosity by reaching out to a homeless fan. The fan had gained attention for watching the "All My Life" music video using a projector inside a tent. As such, Durk wanted to make a positive and lasting impact on the fan's life. To say thank you, the rapper provided him with a hotel room for 30 days. Additionally, he gave him a mobile phone, gift cards, and an undisclosed amount of cash.</p><p>Durk <a href=# rel>expressed his intentions during an Instagram Live video</a> while driving around Los Angeles. In the video, he stated, "I want to do something real special. I got kindness in my heart, right?" Then, he located the homeless man and approached him in person. "You know you were playing the video on the screen, 'All My Life.' You know that's me featuring J. Cole?" Durk said to the man. "So look, I got you a room for 30 days, I'ma give you a couple of dollars, I'ma give you gift cards, and I'ma give you a phone for showing support."

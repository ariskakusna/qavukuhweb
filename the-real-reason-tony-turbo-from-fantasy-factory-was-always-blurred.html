"He is someone that works for me that just wants to be on TV so bad. He is constantly interjecting his way into scenes," the MTV star dished to <a href=#>Paper</a>. "It just led all the way to this. It ultimately led to him just being blurred. He likes it. I offered Turbo to be unblurred forever if he would lick Kenny, the test dummy, from his crack to his belly button. But he wouldn't do it."</p><p>Turbo isn't the only celeb on the show that the Fantasy Factory boss has blurred in the past. In <a href=#>one particular episode</a> of the MTV series, Dyrdek went completely crazy as the censorship czar. "It's like this incredible power ... I can blur anyone," he boasts as he waved his hands in front of his dog, then in front of his secretary.</p><p>At the end of the day, we're assuming Turbo doesn't mind, considering <a href=#>@Turbo_akaBlurry</a>&nbsp;is his Twitter handle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFhaoJye9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2pvK%2FFjK2sq5qfYrOzu8xmnZqmpJbAunnFmpqtp6Kuerit0maYpa%2BRrsBursuuqaudlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

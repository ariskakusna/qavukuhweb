The continuous postponements of Bhavadeeyudu and Pawan’s sudden interest in the Vinodaya Sittam remake have left the Harish Shankar in dilemma.</p><p>Now with the uncertainty of shooting dates, Pooja Hegde is heard to have quit the film. Though she is not interested to let a film with Pawan Kalyan go from her hands, it is her hectic schedule that forced her to do so. Pooja has prior commitments for the Mahesh Babu-Trivikram movie and she is already busy with Salman Khan’s Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali.</p><p>The pan-India project of NTR and Koratala Siva is also looking at Pooja Hegde for the female lead role. She also has got Puri and Vijay Deverakonda’s Jana Gana Mana in hand. With no option left, Pooja Hegde reportedly bid adieu to Bhavadeeyudu.</p><p>On the other hand, Pawan Kalyan’s Hari Hara Veera Mallu is also getting delayed and its release for Sankranthi 2023 is still a doubt. With Samuthirakhani getting busy in other films and Pawan Kalyan being active in Janasena activities, the remake of Vinodaya Sittam too is delayed.</p><p>Well, now it has to be seen who Harish Shankar pulls in on board for Bhavadeeyudu Bhagat Singh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcp52nqHxyg5JybGpnoKS8q62MoZygnJVivLbAjKidZqibqHqjtMCvmJ2dla7CpcE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

While much of the attention paid to new cast members was pointed in the direction of Megan Fox, there was also another surprise special guest. Rapper <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a>, whose no stranger to movie roles has officially been confirmed for the film. 50 posted a teaser related to this film to his Instagram earlier this week with a caption that had fans salivating. “You’re not gonna wanna miss this,” says the post which debuted the poster for the upcoming film.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's been nine years since the previous expendables film came out, the franchise's third entry. After the film, Sylvester Stallone left the franchise due to unspecified creative differences. Thankfully, Stallone is back for the fourth film. The movie is slated to drop later this year on September 22nd. The plot seems to revolve around the various action heroes taking on terrorists with plans to deploy nuclear weapons. Further details are likely to be revealed in future trailers.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-becomes-an-expendable>50 Cent Becomes An Expendable</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Reports that Megan Fox and 50 Cent were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">slated to join the cast</a> go WAY back. Though the film has taken a pretty long journey to get here it looks like the spectacle it's delivering will be worth it. Joining Stallone, 50, and Megan Fox in the film is an all-star cast of heroes. Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Andy Garcia, Tony Jaa, and more are also set to appear in the new movie. Also joining the franchise is Need For Speed director Scott Waugh who directed EXPEND4BLES.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite being pretty quiet on the music front, 50 finds a way to stay in the headlines. He hasn't released anything new in 2023 musically and last year he dropped just one new single with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jeremih</a>. Still, there's been a constant stream of 50 Cent stories in the news recently. Just a few days ago he garnered attention for leaving a $1000 tip at a New York steakhouse following a dinner with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DaBaby</a>.

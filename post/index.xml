It's taken me so long to do this
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight

Saving my place as life forgets
Maybe it's time I saw the world
I'm only here for a while
But patience is not my style</description></item><item><title>'Locusts' Review</title><link>/locusts-1258461.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/locusts-1258461.html</guid><description>If you’re planning a trip to Australia, here’s a friendly word of advice: stick to big cities, like Sydney and Melbourne.

"He ain't worth missin, we should be kissin"
However, if we dig a bit deeper into the lyritical contextualism, it's actually a song about a guy (the singer) trying to convince the girl that, the guys shes missing isn't worth it and he (the singer) should be kissing him.</description></item><item><title>Trisha Paytas divides internet after naming first child Malibu Barbie</title><link>/trisha-paytas-divides-internet-after-naming-first-child-malibu-barbie.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/trisha-paytas-divides-internet-after-naming-first-child-malibu-barbie.html</guid><description>Trisha Paytas recently welcomed daughter Malibu Barbie.

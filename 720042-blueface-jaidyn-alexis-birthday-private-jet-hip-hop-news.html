Moreover, he recently posted some pictures of the two alongside backup dancers outside of a private jet, seemingly for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the music video she's dropping later today</a>. "Today is all about Jaidyn," the rapper wrote on Instagram as his caption with a blue heart emoji. "@officialjaidynalexxis go wish her a HBD she drops a new single 'Barbie' at 3pm westcoast time." Furthermore, the First Lady of MILF Music, his label, is going to have a pretty significant 24 hours, and it looks like they're having a lot of fun in the process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, it's not like things have all been peaches and cream for the couple, especially as of late. With the birth of his son with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chrisean Rock</a>, Blueface faced a wrench in his relationship, as he now has two families to handle. Sure, the California MC is no stranger to this dynamic, but it's blown up in such a high-profile way that it would be a mistake not to capitalize on it. As much as that emphasis elicited groans from a lot of online users, it's unlikely that they'll find escape anytime soon.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jaidyn-alexis-blueface-in-front-of-a-private-jet>Jaidyn Alexis & Blueface In Front Of A Private Jet</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Me [and] Jaidyn got the same [mouths] to feed," Blueface tweeted on Saturday (September 30) concerning his relationship with Jaidyn Alexis. "So it only [makes] sense <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">we make generational wealth together</a>." "Make sure all y'all wish her a happy birthday," the "BDD" provocateur added on the social media platform later today (October 2). "Video dropping today... MILF MUSIC. It's a real b***h C-Day today. First Lady of MILF MUSIC, the one y'all love to hate. TURN MY B***H UP TODAY ON SY."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, as Blue's high school sweetheart's career continues to develop, so does her family complications with him. It's been a wild ride to witness, and one that has the 26-year-old seemingly going back and forth between all love and no love with both his baby mamas. What's more is that it surely won't let up, if only for the sake of the ludicrous amount of clicks they get off of it.

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.

R-Truth ultimately cost Priest the match by unintentionally distracting the referee, allowing McIntyre to hit the Claymore kick on Priest for the win.</p><p>After Monday Night RAW went off the air, R-Truth came to Damian Priest and raised his hand. Priest would then signal to Truth to go to the back and he happily followed, even doing a heel click in the process.</p><p>In case you didn’t know,&nbsp;<a href=#>Damian Priest advocated for R-Truth to work with The Judgment Day in the first place</a>.

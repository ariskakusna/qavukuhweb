Some had complained that the cheapest rooms available via the system are $200 (£175) a night.&nbsp;</p><p>Matt Willis, who works with the Football Supporters Association, told Telegraph Sport how the most dedicated England regulars can expect their total trip to cost £7,000 if the team reaches the final or the playoff for third place. To put the scale of costs into context, he explained that he had spent just £1,000 watching England in Russia at the group stages.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Qatar's Supreme Committee said in a recent press conference that budget accomodation was still being made available, with more than 30,000 rooms released in a week. "The SC has reserved a wide range of accommodation for fans to choose from - including hotels, cruise ships, apartments, villas, cabins or tents in the fan village," said a briefing note shared with Telegraph Sport.&nbsp;</p><p>"The cheapest apartments and holiday villas start from as little as $80 per room/per night, based on two-person occupancy. Fans will also be able to try our unique, prestige accommodation – like cruise ship hotels – for affordable prices, starting at just $175 per night."&nbsp;</p><p>Caravan City, managed by&nbsp;operator Asco Trading, says it is "just a short distance away" from the Al Asmakh and Al Mirqab malls. "Joaan Metro Station is just 500m away, so fans can easily explore Doha," an advert claims.</p><p>Accommodation is in sharp contrast with the vast array of newly-built luxury hotels and cruise ships that will host other fans, including family and friends of the England players. Gareth Southgate’s squad, meanwhile, are booked to stay at five star Souq Al Wakra in Al Wakrah, south of Doha.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJ6fpMGjrculZmtoYmd8cnyOa29oqJmYwba%2BxJ1koKGRo8FuuM6rqbJloJa%2FrHnLqK5mmqWZtKbAjKGmrZ2cYryxwMiopWapkamus3nWqKmlnF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

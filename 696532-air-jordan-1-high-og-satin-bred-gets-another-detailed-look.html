Although not everyone loves this sneaker, everyone certainly respects it. If you own a pair of these, you are very lucky.

Additionally, there are even more to come. Having said that, a lot of these models are currently in the midst of being teased. Fans are very excited about all of them, and one should definitely get female sneakerheads excited. Of course, we are talking about the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Air Jordan</a> 1 High OG "Satin Bred." This is a retro of a shoe that was already released a few years ago.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-satin-bred-air-jordan-1-high-og>"Satin Bred" Air Jordan 1 High OG</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Based on the name alone, you can probably figure out that the shoe has a bunch of satin elements to it. Moreover, as the name would suggest, the color blocking is just like the OG "Bred" Jordan. The key difference here is the fact that we have satin instead of leather. It is a solid concept, and it is a luxurious aesthetic that many will find enticing. We're sure other sneakerheads will agree with this assessment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to the Instagram post above, the shoe is set to be released on October 18th. For now, however, this is simply a rumor and not an official release date. That said, some release details for these should be passed along fairly soon.

You stare daggers at the ump, mutter under your breath about robot umps taking over the world, and then...well, in MLB The Show 23, you kinda just have to take it on the chin...unless?</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:204>There's a glimmer of hope, my friends, a way to fight the (pre-programmed) power and maybe, just maybe, get that call overturned. But before we delve into the nitty-gritty, let's establish a crucial fact:</p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:57><strong>You Don't Actually Challenge Calls in MLB The Show 23</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:241><strong>That's right, folks. You can't directly throw a mini tantrum and demand a replay.</strong> This isn't Madden where you can challenge every ticky-tack flag. But fear not, because there's a hidden mechanic at play, a whisper in the digital wind...</p><h2 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:55>The Manager Whisperer: How the AI Decides Your Fate</h2><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:231>Here's the deal: <strong>the game itself decides if a call can be challenged</strong>. If it's a close play, the manager (bless his pixelated heart) might just take matters into his own hands. A prompt will appear, asking the age-old question:</p><p data-sourcepos=15:3-15:42><strong>"Do you want to challenge the call?"</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:193><strong>This, my friends, is your moment.</strong> Here's where you channel your inner Joe Buck and unleash your best "are you blind, ref?!" impression (within the confines of your living room, of course).</p><h2 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:70>But Wait, There's More! How to Increase Your Chances of a Challenge</h2><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:182>Now, while the game throws the dice on challenges, there might be some subtle ways to tip the odds in your favor. Here are some entirely unconfirmed (but totally plausible) theories:</p><ul data-sourcepos=23:1-25:0><li data-sourcepos=23:1-23:175><strong>The Power of the Replay:</strong> After a close call, linger on the replay screen. Maybe, just maybe, the extra scrutiny will guilt the game gods into offering you a challenge.</li><li data-sourcepos=24:1-25:0><strong>The Pleading Manager:</strong> Some say repeatedly pressing buttons during a close call (think of it as a digital rain dance) might nudge the manager towards a challenge. Science? Unlikely. Hilarious? Absolutely.</li></ul><h2 data-sourcepos=26:1-26:67>The Final Verdict: A Game of Patience (and Maybe Button Mashing)</h2><p data-sourcepos=28:1-28:225>MLB The Show 23's challenge system is a bit of a mystery box. You can't force it, but you can hope, pray, and maybe even engage in some strategic button mashing. Hey, if it gets you that overturned call, who are we to judge?</p><p data-sourcepos=30:1-30:263>So there you have it, folks. A guide to the not-so-straightforward world of challenging calls in MLB The Show 23. Remember, patience is key (and maybe a little button mashing on the side). Now go forth and conquer those questionable calls...virtually, of course.</p>4434497526092775096<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4edOoZJygkaG5prrGnmScmZyheqq6jKajm2Wjnby4eZFsZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

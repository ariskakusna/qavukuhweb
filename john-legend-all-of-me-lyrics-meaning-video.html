"It's just piano, vocals, some robots, a couple of synths, and some Moog bass.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"The weight is all on John's vocal. And then I harmonised a bunch of his vocals to sound like robots - an Eventide piece might have been used, and the TC Helicon VoiceLive. The VoiceLive sounded cool and gave some great results."</p><p class=paragraph-text>"We were inspired by that Imogen Heap song 'Hide And Seek,' he added, "it's kind of this a cappella tune going on with all the harmonisers. The robot harmonisation is subtle - we didn't want to overdo it - but it lends a little cool character to the whole thing."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=8><h2 class=title>How did it perform in the charts?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>In the UK, John Legend hadn't had a hit since 2004's 'Ordinary People'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Ten years later, 'All of Me' reached number one and sold over 1.8 million copies, and was the third highest-selling single of 2014.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It also topped the US Billboard Hot 100, selling a huge 5.8 million copies to date.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=11.961764705882><h2 class=title>'All of Me' music video: Where was it filmed?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/450p7goxZqg/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>John Legend - All of Me (Edited Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>The song's music video was shot in Italy, just days before John Legend's wedding.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The video also features his then fiancé, <a href=#>model Chrissy Teigen</a>.

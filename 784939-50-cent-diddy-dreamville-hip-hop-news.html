"I love you, my brother -– no P. Diddy," he said to the crowd, who responded with exclamations, some laughs, and an overall befuddled tone. "I love you... even if you're a sex worker." Of course, the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Unit</a> mogul didn't really surprise anyone with this jab, as it's pretty much <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">all he's been doing on the 'Gram as of late</a>. Still, to see it at a large scale is pretty wild, and it goes to show that his spirit isn't merely contained by social media.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That being said, 50 Cent has some allegations of sexual assault of his own to address (<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">which he's denied</a>) from Daphne Joy, his child's mother who Diddy stands accused of hiring as a sex worker in Rodney "Lil Rod" Jones' $30 million lawsuit against him. On this matter, he's standing by his claim of innocence. Regardless, it seems like everyone that even slightly involves themselves in this situation suddenly has a target on their back for either Sean Combs' defenders or his detractors. But Fif's never been one to put out a fire quietly, and we're sure he'll continue to douse some gasoline on the discussion.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-50-cent-trolls-diddy-at-dreamville-fest-watch>50 Cent Trolls Diddy At Dreamville Fest: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">50 Cent aside, the most recent development in the Diddy situation involves another of his alleged sex workers, model Jane Ramey, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">denying this status</a>. "Yes, I dated someone," she shared, reportedly via her publicist. "Dating someone doesn't directly correlate to any of the false allegations made. How unfortunate we've entered a time where caring for someone or falling in love is worthy of scrutiny in the court of public opinion. What may be amusing for you is&nbsp;real life for others, and my feelings have never been for entertainment, nor are they up for discussion. We need to be more conscious as a society when ridiculing people’s lives and relationships merely for enjoyment. I appreciate everyone’s kind messages and support during this time."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, what do you think about this jab?

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.

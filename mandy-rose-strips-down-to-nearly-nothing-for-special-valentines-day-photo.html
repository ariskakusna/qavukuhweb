She recently posted a jaw-dropping black bikini photo <a href=#>on Instagram</a>, wishing her fans a very Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day with a giant rose in her hand.</p><p>‚ÄúHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day! üåπ 85% off today on my VIP site! LINK IN BIO ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.‚Äù</p><p>Mandy Rose has recently been on a spree of dropping beautiful and exotic photos on her social media. This pretty much hints at the fact that her focus is completely <a href=#>on building her own brand</a> to a much higher level.</p><p>The former God‚Äôs Greatest Creation went under a career resurgence in 2021 when she returned to NXT. This led to Mandy Rose, donning a new gimmick, defeating Raquel Rodriguez to win the NXT Women‚Äôs championship that she held for 413 days.</p><p>However, Mandy Rose‚Äôs dominant title reign came to a crashing halt as she was dethroned by Roxanne Perez in December 2022. Furthermore, she was released by WWE right after, for posting adult content on her private webpage, violating WWE‚Äôs moral code of conduct.</p><p>Mandy Rose took over a month to open up about her release from WWE and outlined that she had left the door open for returning, following a long conversation with the management. We will have to wait and see if Rose does decide to return to wrestling in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p><strong>What is your take on this story?
